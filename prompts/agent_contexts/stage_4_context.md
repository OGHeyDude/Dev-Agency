# Stage 4: Release & Retrospective Context

## Stage Overview
**Stage 4** is the final phase where validated features are released to production and the team captures learnings for continuous improvement. This stage combines deployment with systematic reflection.

## Agent Role in Stage 4
Agents in this stage act as **deployment coordinators** and **learning facilitators**, managing:
- Safe production deployment
- Performance monitoring
- Knowledge capture
- Process improvement
- Sprint closure

## Required Context Elements

### 1. Release Package
```yaml
release_context:
  sprint_id: [Sprint N]
  feature: [Feature name]

  approval:
    approved_by: [User/Role]
    approved_at: [Timestamp]
    conditions: [Any conditions]
  deployment:
    target: [production|staging]
    strategy: [blue-green|canary|direct]
    rollback_plan: [Defined strategy]
```

### 2. Sprint Summary
```yaml

## Deployment Protocols

### Safe Deployment Process
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Stage 4 Deployment Script

# Pre-deployment checks
echo "üîç Running pre-deployment validation..."
npm run test:production
npm run security:scan

# Create release tag
VERSION=$(npm version patch)
git tag -a "$VERSION" -m "Release: [Feature Name]"
git push origin "$VERSION"

# Deploy with validation
echo "üöÄ Deploying to production..."
npm run deploy:production

# Post-deployment validation
echo "‚úÖ Validating deployment..."
curl -f https://api.prod.com/health || {
  echo "‚ùå Health check failed - initiating rollback"
  npm run rollback:production
  exit 1
}

# Performance validation
RESPONSE_TIME=$(curl -w "%{time_total}" -o /dev/null -s https://api.prod.com)
if (( $(echo "$RESPONSE_TIME > 0.2" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Performance degradation detected"
  # Alert but don't rollback
fi

echo "‚úÖ Deployment successful"
```

### Rollback Procedures
```yaml
rollback_strategy:
  detection:
    - Health check failures
    - Performance degradation >50%
    - Error rate >5%
    - Customer reports
  
  automatic_triggers:
    - 5xx errors >10/minute
    - Response time >1 second
    - Memory usage >90%
  
  process:
    1. Revert to previous version
    2. Verify rollback successful
    3. Create incident report
    4. Notify stakeholders
    5. Schedule post-mortem
```

## Retrospective Analysis

### Metrics Collection
```yaml
metrics_to_analyze:
  velocity:
    planned_vs_actual: [Compare story points]
    trend: [Calculate over last 3 sprints]
    accuracy: [Estimation precision]
  
  quality:
    defect_rate: [Bugs per story point]
    test_coverage_trend: [Coverage over time]
    code_review_findings: [Issues found in review]
  
  efficiency:
    cycle_time: [Ticket start to done]
    blocking_time: [Time spent blocked]
    rework_rate: [Tickets requiring fixes]
  
  automation:
    manual_interventions: [Count and reasons]
    automation_failures: [What broke and why]
    token_efficiency: [Usage optimization]
```

### Pattern Recognition
