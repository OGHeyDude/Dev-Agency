# Sprint Management Recipe

## Overview
Master strategic playbook for sprint planning and orchestration. Enforces complete development cycle: Research â†’ Plan â†’ Develop â†’ Test â†’ Document â†’ Track â†’ Commit. Supports themed sprints for focused, quality-driven development.

## Philosophy
"Strategic focus with tactical flexibility" - Define sprint themes for clarity while letting agents use their capabilities to achieve goals.

## Sprint Themes
- **Development:** Mix of features (70%) and critical bugs (30%)
- **Bug Bash:** Focused bug resolution sprint
- **Refactoring:** Technical debt reduction
- **Database:** Schema changes and migrations
- **Documentation:** Documentation improvement and standardization

---

## Phase 1: Theme Selection & Context Loading

**Goal:** Determine sprint focus and load complete project context

**Process:**
1. Present theme selection to user:
   - Development Sprint (standard feature/bug mix)
   - Bug Bash Sprint (stability focus)
   - Refactoring Sprint (technical debt)
   - Database Sprint (schema/migration work)
   - Documentation Sprint (doc improvement)

2. Load essential context:
   - Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for technical landscape
   - Review PROJECT_PLAN.md for backlog and velocity
   - Check previous sprint metrics and patterns
   - Establish theme-specific success criteria

**Output:** Sprint theme with constraints and full context

---

## Phase 2: Intelligent Ticket Selection

**Goal:** Curate tickets matching theme and capacity

**Agent:** `/agent:architect`

**Context Package:**
- Sprint theme and its constraints
- Complete PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (tech stack, architecture, business goals)
- Current backlog from PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Velocity data (target: 30-35 story points)
- Previous sprint patterns and blockers

**Selection Strategy by Theme:**
- **Development:** Balance features (70%) with critical bugs (30%), prioritize business value
- **Bug Bash:** Only bug tickets, ordered by severity and user impact
- **Refactoring:** Technical debt tickets ranked by ROI and risk reduction
- **Database:** Schema changes and migrations with dependency ordering
- **Documentation:** Doc tickets prioritized by user impact and completeness gaps

**Output:** Curated ticket list with selection rationale

---

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Spec Validation

**Goal:** Ensure all selected tickets have complete specifications

**Process:**
1. Check each ticket for existing spec in /Project_Management/Specs/
2. For tickets without complete specs:
   - **Agent:** `/agent:documenter`
   - **Context:** Ticket requirements, acceptance criteria template, existing patterns
   - **Generate:** Complete spec with testable criteria
3. Validate all specs include:
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Technical approach notes
   - Integration requirements
   - Success metrics

**Output:** All tickets have validated, complete specifications

---

## Phase 4: Strategic Implementation Planning

**Goal:** Create optimal execution sequence with parallelization

**Agent:** `/agent:architect`

**Context Package:**
- All tickets with complete specs
- Technical dependencies from PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Risk assessment for each ticket
- Available agent specializations
- Parallelization opportunities

**Planning Considerations:**
- Dependency ordering (blockers first)
- Risk balancing (mix high/low risk)
- Resource optimization (parallel where possible)
- Quality gate scheduling

**Output:** Implementation sequence with agent assignments

---

## Phase 5: Sprint Plan Generation

**Goal:** Produce executable sprint plan document

**Format:**
```markdown
# Sprint [N] Execution Plan
Theme: [Selected Theme]
Points: [Total Story Points]
Duration: [Start Date] - [End Date]

## Execution Sequence
| Priority | Ticket ID | Title | Points | Recipe | Dependencies | Primary Agent |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | TICKET-001 | [Title] | 5 | tdd_feature_recipe | None | coder |
| 2 | BUG-001 | [Title] | 3 | bug_fix_recipe | None | testerâ†’coder |
| 3 | TICKET-002 | [Title] | 8 | tdd_feature_recipe | TICKET-001 | coder |

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All specs validated before development
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for new code
- [ ] Documentation updated for all changes
- [ ] PROJECT_CONTEXT.md updated if architecture changes
- [ ] All tickets tracked in PROJECT_PLAN.md
```

**Output:** Complete sprint plan ready for execution

---

## Phase 6: Sprint Execution & Management (DETAILED)

**Goal:** Execute entire sprint automatically after user approval with full development cycle enforcement

**Trigger:** User approves sprint plan from Phase 5

### File Management Guidelines
```markdown
## File Organization During Sprint
- Temporary/working files â†’ `/Project_Management/temp/`
- Test files â†’ `/src/[module]/__tests__/`
- User documentation â†’ `/docs/[category]/`
- Development docs â†’ `/docs/development/[category]/`
- Sprint artifacts â†’ `/Project_Management/Sprint Retrospectives/`
```

### Recipe Selection Matrix
| Ticket Type/Keywords | Recipe to Use | Test Location | Doc Location |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Agent Development | tdd_feature_recipe | /src/agents/__tests__/ | /docs/agents/ |
| Analytics/Dashboard | tdd_feature_recipe | /src/analytics/__tests__/ | /docs/features/analytics/ |
| Intelligence/Learning | tdd_feature_recipe | /src/learning/__tests__/ | /docs/development/ai/ |
| Integration | tdd_feature_recipe | /src/integrations/__tests__/ | /docs/integrations/ |
| Orchestration/System | tdd_feature_recipe | /src/system/__tests__/ | /docs/development/architecture/ |
| Bug Fix | bug_fix_recipe | Near bug location | Update existing docs |
| Refactoring | refactoring_workflow | Existing test location | Update affected docs |
| Database | database_migration_recipe | /src/database/__tests__/ | /docs/development/deployment/ |
| Documentation | documentation_standardization | N/A | /docs/[appropriate category]/ |

### Detailed Execution Process

**FOR EACH TICKET IN SPRINT:**

#### Step 1: Initialize Ticket
```bash
# Read ticket specification
Read /Project_Management/Specs/[TICKET-ID]_spec.md

# Update status: TODO â†’ IN_PROGRESS
Edit PROJECT_PLAN.md

# Create workspace
mkdir -p /Project_Management/temp/[TICKET-ID]/

# Report: "Starting [TICKET-ID]: [Title]"
```

#### Step 2: Test Creation Phase (BLOCKING CHECKPOINT)
```bash
# Select test location based on ticket type
# Create test file BEFORE implementation
Write /src/[module]/__tests__/[ticket-id].test.ts

# Test structure MUST include:
- At least one test per acceptance criteria
- Clear test descriptions
- Proper setup and teardown

# Run tests to confirm they FAIL
Bash npm test [module]

# Save output
Bash npm test > /Project_Management/temp/[TICKET-ID]/test-red.log
```

Write /src/[module]/[implementation].ts

# Follow TDD principle: Write minimum code to pass tests
# Use existing patterns from codebase
# Store any working files in /Project_Management/temp/[TICKET-ID]/

# MANDATORY: Commit checkpoint after implementation
Bash git add -A
Bash git commit -m "feat([TICKET-ID]): implement core functionality

- Add [key implementation details]
- Tests still failing, ready for validation

WIP: Implementation phase complete"
```

## Phase 7: Sprint Retrospective & Closure

**Goal:** Capture learnings, celebrate successes, and prepare for next sprint

**Trigger:** All sprint tickets marked as DONE

### Sprint Commit
```bash
# Review all changes
Bash git status
Bash git diff --stat

# Prepare commit message from Release Notes
Read /Project_Management/Releases/Release_Notes.md

# Create comprehensive sprint commit
Bash git add -A
Bash git commit -m "feat(Sprint-[N]): [Sprint theme and summary]

[List of completed tickets and key features]

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Clear Release Notes for next sprint
Edit /Project_Management/Releases/Release_Notes.md
```

### Generate Retrospective
```bash
# Copy retrospective template
cp /docs/reference/templates/Sprint\ Retrospective\ Template.md \
   /Project_Management/Sprint\ Retrospectives/Sprint_[N]_Retrospective.md

# Fill in retrospective with:
- Sprint metrics (velocity, test coverage, etc.)
- Completed tickets and their impact
- Process compliance checklist
- Identified improvements
- Lessons learned
```

### Retrospective Contents to Capture
1. **What Went Well:**
   - Successful patterns used
   - Process improvements that worked
   - Technical achievements

2. **What Didn't Go Well:**
   - Skipped steps (if any)
   - Blockers encountered

3. **Metrics Analysis:**
   - Planned vs Actual velocity
   - Test coverage achieved
   - Documentation completeness
   - Status transition compliance

4. **Action Items:**
   - Recipe improvements needed
   - Process adjustments
   - Tool/automation opportunities

### Archive Sprint Artifacts
```bash
# Move temp files to archive
mv /Project_Management/temp/[TICKET-*] \
   /Project_Management/Sprint\ Retrospectives/Sprint_[N]_artifacts/

# Update PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Move current sprint to "Previous Sprints"
- Clear current sprint section
- Update velocity metrics
```

**Output:** Complete sprint with retrospective, commit, and archived artifacts
