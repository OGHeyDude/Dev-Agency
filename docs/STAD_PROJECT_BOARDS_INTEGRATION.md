# STAD Project Boards Integration Guide

**Created:** 08-12-2025  
**Boards:** STAD Agentic Patterns, STAD Agents  
**Purpose:** Integrate GitHub Project Boards with STAD Protocol workflow  

---

## 🎯 Overview

Two specialized GitHub Project Boards enhance the STAD Protocol workflow by tracking meta-level concerns:

1. **STAD Agentic Patterns** - Reusable workflow patterns and recipes
2. **STAD Agents** - Agent development and performance tracking

These boards complement the sprint-specific boards by capturing cross-sprint learnings and improvements.

```

#### 3. Semantic Commit Workflow
```yaml
Title: "Semantic Commits with Metadata"

Agents Involved: [All]
Token Savings: 30%
Complexity: Simple

Description: |
  Embed metadata in commit messages.
  Format: type(scope): desc | Key:value | More:data
  Provides perfect audit trail.
```

| **Token Usage** | Number | Average tokens per invocation |

### Example Agent Items

#### 1. Architect Agent Enhancement
```yaml
Title: "Add Mermaid diagram generation to Architect"
Agent Name: Architect
Enhancement Type: New Feature
Story Points: 5
Dependencies: None
Sprint: Sprint 8
Performance Impact: Medium

Description: |
  Generate visual DAG using Mermaid syntax.
  Include in execution plans.
  Improves understanding of dependencies.
```

#### 2. Token Tracking
```yaml
Title: "Add token usage tracking to all agents"
Agent Name: All
Enhancement Type: Optimization
Story Points: 8
Dependencies: Metrics system
Sprint: Sprint 8
Performance Impact: High

Description: |
  Track input/output tokens for each invocation.
  Store in metrics database.
  Generate efficiency reports.
```

## 🔄 Integration with STAD Workflow

### During Sprint Planning

```bash
# 1. Review patterns that could apply
# Check "STAD Agentic Patterns" board (via web)
# Look for patterns matching your sprint theme

# 2. Check agent capabilities
# Review "STAD Agents" board for available features
# Note any limitations or known issues

# 3. Use CLI as proxy (since project API limited)
gh issue list --label "pattern" --label "proven"
gh issue list --label "agent" --label "enhancement"
```

### During Sprint Execution

```yaml
Discovery Phase:
  - Identify new patterns during implementation
  - Note agent performance issues
  - Track token usage and efficiency

Documentation Phase:
  - Create pattern documentation
  - Update agent performance metrics
  - Link discoveries to boards

Validation Phase:
  - Test patterns in real scenarios
  - Measure success rates
  - Validate token savings
```

### During Sprint Retrospective

```bash
# Add discovered patterns
1. Create issue for pattern
2. Add to "STAD Agentic Patterns" board
3. Move through workflow as documented

# Track agent improvements
1. Create enhancement issues
2. Add to "STAD Agents" board
3. Prioritize for next sprint
```

## 📊 Metrics and Reporting

### Pattern Metrics
```sql
-- Track pattern usage and success
SELECT 
  pattern_name,
  COUNT(*) as times_used,
  AVG(token_savings) as avg_savings,
  AVG(success_rate) as avg_success
FROM pattern_applications
GROUP BY pattern_name
ORDER BY times_used DESC;
```

### Agent Performance
```sql
-- Track agent efficiency
SELECT 
  agent_name,
  COUNT(*) as invocations,
  AVG(tokens_used) as avg_tokens,
  AVG(execution_time) as avg_time,
  SUM(CASE WHEN success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) as success_rate
FROM agent_invocations
GROUP BY agent_name;
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Pattern Management

1. **Document Immediately**: Add patterns as soon as discovered
2. **Include Examples**: Always provide concrete usage examples
3. **Measure Impact**: Track token savings and success rates
4. **Share Widely**: Move to Published quickly for team benefit
5. **Version Patterns**: Update rather than duplicate

### For Agent Tracking

1. **Performance First**: Focus on metrics that matter
2. **Small Iterations**: Prefer small enhancements over rewrites
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate in Testing column before deployment
4. **Document Changes**: Update agent docs with enhancements
5. **Track Regressions**: Note when updates decrease performance

## 🔧 Automation Rules (via GitHub UI)

### Suggested Automations

#### For Patterns Board:
- When item moves to "Published" → Add "proven" label to linked issue
- When "Success Rate" > 90% → Auto-move to "Review"
- When "Documentation" field filled → Enable move to "Published"

#### For Agents Board:
- When item moves to "Deployed" → Close linked issue
- When "Performance Impact" = "High" → Add priority label
- When "Story Points" > 8 → Require breakdown into subtasks

## 📝 Quick Reference

### CLI Workarounds
```bash
# Since project API is limited, use issues as proxy:

# Create pattern issue
gh issue create --title "Pattern: [Name]" --label "pattern,sprint-7"

# Create agent enhancement
gh issue create --title "Agent: [Enhancement]" --label "agent,enhancement"

# Query patterns
gh issue list --label "pattern" --state all

# Query agent items
gh issue list --label "agent" --state all
```

### Web UI Tasks
1. Add items to boards
2. Update custom fields
3. Move through columns
4. Link issues to items
5. View board analytics
