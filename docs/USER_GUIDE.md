## 🔄 Development Workflow

### The 5-Step Development Process

**Every task follows this proven methodology:**

#### 1. 📚 Research Phase (`/research`)
- **Purpose**: Understand the problem and existing solutions
- **Activities**: Code analysis, pattern identification, requirement gathering
- **Agent**: Usually manual exploration, `/agent:architect` for complex systems
- **Output**: Research findings and context for planning

#### 2. 🎯 Planning Phase (`/plan`)  
- **Purpose**: Create detailed technical specifications
- **Activities**: System design, component planning, risk assessment
- **Agent**: **`/agent:architect`** (required for complex features)
- **Output**: Technical specification document
- **Status**: `BACKLOG` → `TODO`

#### 3. 🔨 Implementation Phase (`/build`)
- **Purpose**: Build the solution according to specifications
- **Activities**: Code writing, integration, initial testing
- **Agents**: `/agent:coder`, `/agent:mcp-dev`, `/agent:integration`
- **Output**: Working implementation
- **Status**: `TODO` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `CODE_REVIEW`

#### 4. ✅ Validation Phase (`/test`)
- **Purpose**: Ensure quality and correctness
- **Activities**: Testing, security review, performance analysis
- **Agents**: **`/agent:tester`** (required), `/agent:security`, `/agent:performance`
- **Output**: Validated, tested solution
- **Status**: `CODE_REVIEW` → `QA_TESTING`

#### 5. 📖 Documentation Phase (`/document`)
- **Purpose**: Complete all documentation requirements
- **Activities**: User guides, technical docs, API documentation
- **Agent**: `/agent:documenter` (optional, for user-facing docs)
- **Output**: Complete documentation
- **Status**: `QA_TESTING` → `DOCUMENTATION` → `READY_FOR_RELEASE` → `DONE`

### 💡 Pro Tips for Workflow Success

**✅ Do This:**
- Always follow the 5-step process - no shortcuts
- Use `/agent:architect` for system design before coding
- Run `/agent:tester` for quality assurance
- Update ticket status in real-time
- Include relevant context in agent requests

**❌ Avoid This:**
- Skipping the planning phase
- Coding without architectural design
- Missing security reviews for production code
- Incomplete documentation

## 🛠️ Developer Tools

### 🚀 Agent CLI Tool
**Automated agent orchestration and execution**

**Status**: ⚠️ Currently has build issues (54+ TypeScript errors)  
**Workaround**: Use manual agent invocation until CLI is fixed

```bash
# When operational:
cd /home/hd/Desktop/LAB/Dev-Agency/tools/agent-cli/
npm install
npm run build
./dist/cli.js --agent architect --task "design API"
```

**Features** (when working):
- Parallel agent execution (up to 5 agents)
- Recipe automation
- Performance metrics
- Context optimization

### 🧠 Context Optimizer
**Smart token usage optimization**

**Location**: `tools/context_optimizer/`  
**Status**: ✅ Operational

```bash
cd /home/hd/Desktop/LAB/Dev-Agency/tools/context_optimizer/
python cli.py --optimize --input ./my-project/ --output optimized.txt
```

**Benefits**:
- 30-75% context size reduction
- Intelligent content prioritization  
- Token usage optimization
- Better agent performance

### 🔄 Memory Sync Tool
**Keep AI knowledge synchronized with code changes**

**Location**: `utils/memory_sync/`  
**Status**: ✅ Operational

```bash
# Sync all changes
/sync-memory

# Sync specific directory  
/sync-memory path/to/directory

# Force full resync
/sync-memory --force
```

**Use Cases**:
