## üéØ Reason for Archiving

### Primary Reason
**Category:** [Obsolete/Superseded/Deprecated/Refactored/Consolidated/Testing/Experimental/Other]

**Detailed Explanation:**
[Provide clear explanation of why these files are being archived rather than deleted. Be specific about what changed or what superseded these files.]

### Supporting Factors
- [ ] **Code is no longer used** - Functionality replaced or removed
- [ ] **Feature deprecated** - No longer supported in current version
- [ ] **Refactoring completed** - Code restructured and old version obsolete
- [ ] **Documentation outdated** - Newer documentation replaces this content
- [ ] **Configuration obsolete** - New configuration system implemented
- [ ] **Testing artifacts** - Temporary files from testing or development
- [ ] **Experimental code** - Proof-of-concept or prototype no longer needed
- [ ] **Duplicate content** - Consolidated into other files
- [ ] **Security concern** - Contains sensitive data or vulnerable code
- [ ] **Performance issue** - Replaced with more efficient implementation

## üõ°Ô∏è Preservation Rationale

### Why Archive Instead of Delete
- [ ] **Historical reference** - May need to reference implementation details
- [ ] **Compliance requirement** - Regulatory or audit requirements
- [ ] **Learning resource** - Educational value for team members
- [ ] **Rollback possibility** - Potential need to revert changes
- [ ] **Documentation value** - Contains valuable comments or documentation
- [ ] **Legal requirement** - Must retain for legal/contractual reasons
- [ ] **Debugging aid** - May be needed for troubleshooting legacy issues
- [ ] **Pattern reference** - Contains useful coding patterns or approaches

### Retention Period
**Recommended Retention:** [Duration, e.g., "6 months", "1 year", "indefinite"]  
**Review Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD] - [When to review if still needed]  
**Disposal Criteria:** [Conditions under which it could be permanently deleted]

## üîç Future Reference Information

### How to Access Archived Content
1. **Location:** Files are stored in `/Archive/[original-path-structure]/`
2. **Documentation:** This file serves as the index and context
3. **Search:** Use `grep -r "search-term" /Archive/` to find specific content
4. **Restoration:** If needed, copy files back to appropriate location

### Key Content Summary
**Important Functions/Classes/Components:**
- `[ImportantFunction()]` - [Brief description of what it did]
- `[ImportantClass]` - [Brief description of its purpose]
- `[ImportantComponent]` - [Brief description of its role]
