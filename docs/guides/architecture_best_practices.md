# Architecture Best Practices Guide

## Overview

This guide provides best practices for the Architect Agent during Stage 1 (Sprint Preparation) of the STAD Protocol. It covers system design, technical specification creation, and execution planning.

## Core Principles

### 1. Search Before Design
- Always check for existing patterns
- Review similar implementations
- Reuse proven architectures
- Avoid reinventing solutions

### 2. Plan for Zero Intervention
- Document all decisions upfront
- Include fallback strategies
- Define edge case handling
- Provide clear success criteria

### 3. Design for Testability
- Clear interfaces and contracts
- Dependency injection
- Modular components
- Observable behavior

## Stage 1 Responsibilities

### Epic Translation
1. Understand business requirements
2. Identify technical constraints
3. Map to system capabilities
4. Define success metrics

### Technical Specification
1. Create comprehensive specs
2. Include acceptance criteria
3. Document design decisions
4. Identify risks and mitigations

### Execution Planning
1. Create dependency DAG
2. Identify parallelization opportunities
3. Estimate story points accurately
4. Assign appropriate agents

## Design Patterns

### Microservices
- Clear service boundaries
- Well-defined APIs
- Event-driven communication
- Independent deployment

### Monolithic Enhancement
- Module separation
- Layer architecture
- Feature flags
- Progressive enhancement

### Event-Driven
- Event schemas
- Message queues
- Event sourcing
- CQRS when appropriate

## Technical Specification Template

### Structure
1. **Overview** - High-level description
2. **Architecture** - System design
3. **Components** - Detailed breakdown
4. **Data Flow** - Information movement
5. **API Design** - Interfaces and contracts
6. **Testing Strategy** - Validation approach
7. **Risks** - Potential issues and mitigations

### Quality Criteria
- Complete acceptance criteria
- Clear implementation path
- Identified dependencies
- Defined success metrics
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Dependency Management

### DAG Creation
1. Identify all dependencies
2. Map relationships
3. Find critical path
4. Identify parallelization
5. Validate feasibility

### Story Point Estimation
- 1 point: Trivial change
- 2 points: Simple feature
- 3 points: Moderate complexity
- 5 points: Complex feature (max)
- Break down anything larger

## Best Practices

### Documentation
- Document "why" not just "what"
- Include decision rationale
- Provide context for future
- Update as understanding evolves

### Reusability
- Design for reuse
- Create modular components
- Extract common patterns
- Build libraries when appropriate

### Scalability
- Plan for growth
- Design for performance
- Consider resource limits
- Enable horizontal scaling

### Security
- Security by design
- Principle of least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Regular security reviews

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Engineering
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Build for current needs
- Plan for future, don't build it
- YAGNI principle

### Under-Specification
- Don't leave decisions for later
- Document all assumptions
- Define all interfaces
- Specify error handling

### Ignoring Constraints
- Consider technical debt
- Respect system limitations
- Account for team expertise
- Factor in timeline

## Integration Considerations

### External Services
- Define integration points
- Document API contracts
- Plan for failures
- Include retry strategies

### Database Design
- Normalize appropriately
- Plan migrations
- Consider performance
- Document schema

### Performance
- Set performance targets
- Plan for monitoring
- Design for caching
- Consider load patterns

## Handoff Requirements

### To Coder Agent
- Complete technical spec
- Clear implementation steps
- Identified gotchas
- Success criteria
- Test requirements

### Documentation
- Architecture decisions
- Design rationale
- Risk assessment
- Dependency map
- Implementation notes

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Existing patterns researched
- [ ] Requirements fully understood
- [ ] Architecture documented
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Risks identified
- [ ] Story points assigned
- [ ] Agents designated
- [ ] Handoff complete

## Tools and Resources

### Design Tools
- Mermaid for diagrams
- Draw.io for architecture
- PlantUML for sequences
- C4 model for documentation

### Analysis Tools
- Git for history
- Grep for patterns
- Tree for structure
- GitHub for context

## Metrics

### Success Metrics
- Spec completeness
- Estimation accuracy
- Dependency accuracy
- Reuse percentage
- Design quality

### Warning Signs
- Specs frequently revised
- Estimates consistently wrong
- Dependencies missed
- Patterns not reused
- Complex designs
