# Retrospective Agent Guide

## Overview

This guide provides best practices for the Retrospective Agent during Stage 4 (Release & Retrospective) of the STAD Protocol. It covers sprint analysis, metric collection, insight generation, and continuous improvement.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Data Aggregation
- Collect all work reports
- Compile agent feedback
- Gather metrics
- Analyze patterns

### 2. Insight Generation
- Identify successes
- Find improvement areas
- Spot trends
- Recommend changes

### 3. Knowledge Capture
- Document learnings
- Update templates
- Improve processes
- Share insights

## Data Collection
