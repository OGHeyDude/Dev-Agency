# QA Standards Guide

## Overview

This guide defines quality assurance standards for the Backend QA Agent during Stage 3 (Sprint Validation) of the STAD Protocol. It covers API validation, database integrity, performance benchmarking, and security verification.

## Core Principles

### 1. Contract-First Validation
- API contracts are sacred
- Schema compliance mandatory
- Backward compatibility required
- Version management critical

### 2. Data Integrity
- Database constraints enforced
- Referential integrity maintained
- Transaction atomicity verified
- Data consistency validated

### 3. Performance Standards
- Response times within SLA
- Resource usage acceptable
- Scalability demonstrated
- Bottlenecks identified

## API Validation

### Contract Testing
- OpenAPI/Swagger compliance
- Request validation
- Response validation
- Error format consistency

### Endpoint Verification
```
GET    /resource     → 200, 404
POST   /resource     → 201, 400, 409
PUT    /resource/:id → 200, 404, 400
DELETE /resource/:id → 204, 404
```

### Response Standards
- Consistent status codes
- Standard error format
- Proper content types
- CORS headers correct

## Database Validation

### Schema Integrity
- Migrations applied correctly
- Indexes optimized
- Constraints enforced
- Relations valid

### Data Quality
- No orphaned records
- Referential integrity
- Data types correct
- Defaults applied

### Performance
- Query execution plans
- Index usage
- Lock contention
- Connection pooling

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Targets
- Simple GET: <100ms
- Complex query: <500ms
- Data mutation: <200ms
- File upload: <2s/MB

### Throughput Requirements
- Concurrent users supported
- Requests per second
- Database connections
- Memory usage limits

### Load Testing
- Normal load scenarios
- Peak load handling
- Stress testing
- Recovery testing

## Security Validation

### Authentication
- Token validation
- Session management
- Password policies
- MFA when required

### Authorization
- Role-based access
- Resource permissions
- API key validation
- Rate limiting

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- PII handling
- Audit logging

## Testing Procedures

### API Testing Flow
1. Validate contract
2. Test happy path
3. Test error cases
4. Verify security
5. Check performance

### Database Testing Flow
1. Verify schema
2. Check constraints
3. Test transactions
4. Validate queries
5. Assess performance

### Integration Testing
1. End-to-end flows
2. Service interactions
3. External dependencies
4. Error propagation
5. Recovery scenarios

## Review Dashboard Creation

### Required Sections
- API Coverage Report
- Performance Metrics
- Security Scan Results
- Database Health
- Risk Assessment

### Metrics to Include
- Test pass rate
- Coverage percentage
- Performance benchmarks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Technical debt

## Validation Checklists

### API Checklist
- [ ] All endpoints tested
- [ ] Contracts validated
- [ ] Error handling verified
- [ ] Security checked
- [ ] Performance acceptable

### Database Checklist
- [ ] Schema correct
- [ ] Migrations successful
- [ ] Constraints enforced
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Backup verified

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Authorization enforced
- [ ] Data encrypted
- [ ] Vulnerabilities scanned
- [ ] Audit logs active

## Common Issues

### API Issues
- Contract mismatches
- Missing error handling
- Inconsistent responses
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities

### Database Issues
- Migration failures
- Constraint violations
- Slow queries
- Deadlocks
- Connection leaks

### Resolution Strategies
- Document findings clearly
- Provide reproduction steps
- Suggest fixes
- Set severity levels
- Track resolution

## Handoff Requirements

### From Testing Phase
- All unit tests passing
- Integration tests complete
- Test coverage adequate
- Known issues documented

### To Release Phase
- Validation complete

- curl/httpie
- Contract validators

### Database Tools
- Query analyzers
- Migration tools
- Schema validators
- Performance monitors

### Security Tools
- OWASP scanners
