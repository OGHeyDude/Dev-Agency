| FEAT-027 | High | /agent:architect + /agent:coder | 8 |
| FEAT-028 | Medium | /agent:coder | 5 |
| BUG-011 | Low | /agent:tester | 2 |
```

### Ticket Status Updates Protocol

```bash
# Before starting work
/cmd
# Update PROJECT_PLAN.md: BACKLOG → TODO → IN_PROGRESS

# During development
# Update progress every 2 hours or major milestones

# Before submitting PR
# Update PROJECT_PLAN.md: IN_PROGRESS → CODE_REVIEW
```

### Conflict Prevention Rules

1. **Exclusive Ticket Assignment**: One developer per ticket
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Mark dependent tickets explicitly
3. **Regular Status Updates**: Every 4 hours minimum
4. **Blocked Ticket Protocol**: Immediate team notification

---

## Agent Coordination Between Team Members

### Agent Assignment Matrix

| Developer Level | Recommended Agents | Approval Required |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Junior | /agent:coder, /agent:tester | Senior review |
| Mid-level | All standard agents | /agent:security only |
| Senior | All agents | None |
| Lead | All agents + coordination | None |

### Agent Context Sharing

**Shared Agent Outputs Location**: `/Project_Management/Agent_Outputs/`

```bash
# Save agent outputs for team sharing
/agent:architect > /Project_Management/Agent_Outputs/FEAT-025_architecture.md

# Reference previous agent work
cat /Project_Management/Agent_Outputs/FEAT-024_patterns.md
```

### Parallel Agent Execution

**Scenario**: Multiple developers working on related features

```markdown
## Coordinated Agent Usage - Feature Set Alpha

### Developer A (Alice)
- Ticket: FEAT-025 (User Authentication)
- Agent: /agent:coder + /agent:security
- Dependencies: None

### Developer B (Bob)  
- Ticket: FEAT-026 (User Profile API)
- Agent: /agent:mcp-dev
- Dependencies: Wait for FEAT-025 security patterns

### Developer C (Carol)
- Ticket: FEAT-027 (Profile UI Components)
- Agent: /agent:coder
- Dependencies: Wait for FEAT-026 API contract

### Coordination Plan
1. Alice shares security patterns → Bob references them
2. Bob shares API contract → Carol implements UI
3. All three collaborate on integration testing
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Types of Team Conflicts in Agent-Enhanced Development

#### 1. Agent Output Disagreements

**Scenario**: Two developers get different recommendations from the same agent type

**Resolution Protocol**:
```markdown
## Agent Conflict Resolution Process

### Step 1: Document the Conflict
- Agent: /agent:coder
- Developer A Output: [Recommendation A]
- Developer B Output: [Recommendation B]
- Context Difference: [What was different in the prompts]

### Step 2: Analyze Context Differences
- Compare agent inputs and context
- Identify variables that led to different outputs
- Determine which context is more accurate

### Step 3: Escalate to Senior Agent Review
- Use /agent:architect for architectural decisions
- Get team lead to provide unified context
- Document resolution for future reference

### Step 4: Update Team Guidelines
- Add context requirements to prevent future conflicts
- Update agent usage guidelines
- Share learnings in team documentation
```

#### 2. Merge Conflicts in Agent-Generated Code

**Prevention Strategy**:
```bash
# Before starting work
git fetch origin
git checkout -b feature/FEAT-XXX develop

# Use agent with current codebase context
/agent:coder --context="latest develop branch" --no-conflicts-mode

# Regular synchronization
git fetch origin develop
git rebase develop  # Resolve conflicts early and often
```

**Resolution Process**:
```markdown
## Merge Conflict Resolution with Agent Assistance

### Step 1: Analyze Conflicting Changes
```bash
git status
git diff HEAD~1..HEAD  # Your changes
git diff develop..HEAD  # Conflicting changes
```

### Step 2: Use Agent for Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Get agent recommendation for conflict resolution
/agent:coder --resolve-conflicts \
  --your-changes="path/to/your/file" \
  --their-changes="path/to/their/file" \
  --context="feature integration"
```

### Step 3: Validate Resolution
- Run full test suite
- Verify both features work independently
- Check integration points
- Get peer review of resolution
```

#### 3. Resource Conflicts (Agent Usage)

**Scenario**: Multiple developers need the same specialized agent simultaneously

**Load Balancing Strategy**:
```markdown
## Agent Resource Management

### Priority Queue
1. **Critical Bug Fixes** - Immediate access
2. **Sprint Commitments** - Daily time slots
3. **Exploration/Research** - Off-peak hours
4. **Documentation** - Flexible timing

### Agent Scheduling
- **Morning (9-11 AM)**: /agent:architect for planning
- **Peak Hours (11 AM-4 PM)**: /agent:coder for implementation
- **Afternoon (4-6 PM)**: /agent:tester for validation
- **Evening (6-8 PM)**: /agent:documenter for docs

### Escalation Path
1. Check agent queue: `/agent-status`
2. Schedule time slot: `/agent-schedule /agent:type time-slot`
3. If urgent, contact team lead
4. Consider alternative agent if suitable
```
