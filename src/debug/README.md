# Debug and Trace Visualization System

Advanced debugging and trace visualization for the Dev-Agency system with interactive visual representations of agent execution flows, decision trees, token usage patterns, and performance bottlenecks.

## Features

- **Visual Execution Flow Diagrams**: Interactive flowcharts showing agent execution sequences
- **Token Usage Visualization**: Real-time and historical token consumption with heat maps
- **Interactive Decision Tree Explorer**: Expandable decision trees with confidence scores
- **Breakpoint and Step-through Debugging**: Set breakpoints with state inspection
- **Performance Bottleneck Detection**: Automated identification of slow operations
- **Multi-Agent Workflow Tracing**: Complex workflow visualization with timelines

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **TraceCollector**: Capture detailed execution data from agent runs
- **DebugServer**: WebSocket server for real-time debugging interface
- **VisualizationEngine**: D3.js-based interactive visualizations
- **BreakpointManager**: Handle debugging breakpoints and step execution
- **PerformanceAnalyzer**: Detect bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

### Integration Points

- Extends existing ExecutionEngine for trace collection
- Integrates with Logger for enhanced trace data
- Connects with HealthDashboard for real-time monitoring
- Uses PerformanceCache for optimization insights

## Usage

```typescript
import { DebugVisualizer } from './DebugVisualizer';
import { TraceCollector } from './TraceCollector';

// Initialize debugging
const debugger = new DebugVisualizer({
  port: 8081,
  enableBreakpoints: true,
  enablePerformanceAnalysis: true
});

await debugger.start();

// Collect traces from agent execution
const traceCollector = new TraceCollector();
await traceCollector.attachToExecutionEngine(executionEngine);
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /debug/status` - Debugging system status
- `GET /debug/traces/:executionId` - Get execution trace
- `POST /debug/breakpoints` - Set/manage breakpoints  
- `GET /debug/performance` - Performance analysis data
- `GET /debug/flow/:workflowId` - Workflow visualization data

## WebSocket Events

- `trace:execution-started` - Execution trace began
- `trace:execution-step` - Step completed in execution
- `breakpoint:hit` - Breakpoint encountered
- `performance:bottleneck-detected` - Performance issue identified

## Security Considerations

- All trace data is sanitized before storage/transmission
- Breakpoint access requires proper authentication
- Sensitive execution context is filtered from traces
- File system access is restricted and validated

## Dependencies

- React 18+ with TypeScript for web interface
- D3.js for interactive visualizations
- Cytoscape.js for network diagrams
- Monaco Editor for code inspection
- WebSocket for real-time communication
