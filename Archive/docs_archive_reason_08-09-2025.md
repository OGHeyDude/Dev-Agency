# Archive Reason: Docs Directory

**Directory Archived:** /docs/  
**Date Archived:** 08-09-2025  
**Reason:** Consolidated into README.md for single source of truth  

## Details
The docs directory contained 6 files with overlapping documentation:
- AGENT_SYSTEM.md (341 lines)
- AGENT_PROMPTS.md (533 lines)
- CENTRAL_SYSTEM.md (253 lines)
- INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md (246 lines)
- SYSTEM_IMPROVEMENTS.md (240 lines)
- WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION.md (512 lines)

Total: 2,125 lines across 6 files

This violated our anti-clutter and single source of truth principles by:
1. Creating multiple places to look for information
2. Requiring updates in multiple files for single changes
3. Having overlapping and redundant content

## What Changed
All essential content has been consolidated into the main README.md, which now serves as the complete system guide. The README is now the single, authoritative source for:
- System architecture
- Agent documentation
- Workflow integration
- Setup instructions
- All core concepts

## Benefits
- Single place to look for all information
- No duplicate updates needed
- Follows our core principles
- Easier maintenance
