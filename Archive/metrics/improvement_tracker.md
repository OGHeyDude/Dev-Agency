# Agent System Improvement Tracker

## Purpose
Document prompt refinements, context optimizations, and system improvements based on real usage.

## Improvement Categories

### 1. Prompt Refinements
Track changes to agent prompts that improve output quality.

#### Template
```markdown
### [Date] - [Agent] - v[Version]

**Original Prompt Issue:**
[What wasn't working]

**Refinement:**
[What was changed]

**Result:**
[Improvement observed]

**New Version Stored:**
`/prompts/[domain]/[agent]_v[version].md`
```

### 2. Context Optimizations
Document ways to reduce token usage while maintaining quality.

#### Template
```markdown
### [Date] - [Optimization Name]

**Original Context Size:** [tokens/lines]
**Optimized Size:** [tokens/lines]
**Reduction:** [percentage]

**Technique:**
[How context was optimized]

**Quality Impact:**
[Any changes to output quality]
```

### 3. Agent Combination Patterns
Successful agent sequences that become recipes.

#### Template
```markdown
### [Date] - [Pattern Name]

**Agents Used:** [List in order]
**Task Type:** [What this solves]
**Success Rate:** [Percentage]

**Sequence:**
1. [Agent 1]: [Purpose]
2. [Agent 2]: [Purpose]
...

**Recipe Created:** `/recipes/[name].md`
```

## Improvement Log

### 08-09-2025 - System Initialize - v1.0

**Initial Setup:**
- Created comprehensive agent definitions
- Established prompt templates
- Built tracking infrastructure

**Baseline Established:**
- 9 specialized agents defined
- Hub-and-spoke architecture documented
- Integration with 5-step workflow

**Next Improvements Needed:**
1. Test with real tasks
2. Measure baseline performance
3. Identify context optimization opportunities
