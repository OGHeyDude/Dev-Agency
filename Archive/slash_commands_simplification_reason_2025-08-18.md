# Archive Reason: Command Simplification

**Date Archived:** 2025-08-18  
**Original File:** `/prompts/slash_commands.md`  
**Archived To:** `/Archive/slash_commands_pre_simplification_2025-08-19.md`  
**Related Ticket:** Command Simplification Project (see /Project_Management/TEMP/command_simplification_checklist.md)

## Reason for Archive

The Dev-Agency slash commands system has been simplified from 100+ commands to exactly 9 essential commands to improve usability and maintainability.

### What Was Archived
- Complete 100+ command documentation system
- Complex command aliases and options
- Legacy workflow commands (`/research`, `/plan`, `/build`, etc.)
- Detailed STAD protocol commands (`/validate-stage`, `/bug`, `/revise`, etc.)
- All `/agent:*` commands from user view
- Development workflow commands (`/api-feature`, `/full-stack-feature`, etc.)
- Quality commands (`/bug-fix`, `/tdd-workflow`, `/security-audit`, etc.)
- Infrastructure commands (`/database-migrate`, `/refactor`, etc.)
- Documentation commands (`/doc-audit`, `/doc-template`, etc.)
- Recipe execution commands

### New Simplified System (9 Commands)
1. `/sprint-plan <additional instructions>` - Stage 1: Sprint Planning
2. `/execute` - Stage 2: Sprint Execution
3. `/validate` - Stage 3: Sprint Validation
4. `/sprint-approved` - Stage 4: Release & Retrospective
5. `/cmd` - Initialize Session
6. `/standards <Subject>` - Read Standards
7. `/sync-memory` - Knowledge Graph Sync
8. `/sprint-status` - Progress Report
9. `/backlog <additional information>` - Create Tickets

### Migration Strategy
- Users now see only 9 simple commands
- Internal agents and recipes still work behind the scenes
- Recipes can still call `/agent:*` commands internally
- No `/agent:*` commands visible to users
- Simplified STAD workflow replaces complex validation commands

### Impact
- **Positive:** Much simpler user experience, easier onboarding
- **Positive:** Reduced cognitive load and decision paralysis
- **Positive:** Cleaner documentation and clearer workflow
- **Note:** All functionality preserved - just hidden from user view

- New command definitions: `/prompts/slash_commands.md` (post-simplification)
- Implementation details: All user-facing docs updated to show only 9 commands

**This archive preserves the complete command system for reference and potential future restoration if needed.**
