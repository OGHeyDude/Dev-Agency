# Session Logs Archive Reason

**Date**: 08-09-2025  
**Reason**: Documentation and Organization Sprint - Phase 2 Cleanup

## Files Archived
- All session logs from `/logs/` directory
- Multiple Claude Code session directories with JSON logs
- Session IDs: 1fbd575a, 29923410, 2b2d534f, d2bb2426

## Why Archived
These are runtime session logs that were accumulating in the main development directory. According to Dev-Agency standards:
1. **Active development folders should not contain runtime logs**
2. **Session data should be archived after completion** 
3. **Main directory should remain clean for development focus**

## Impact
- Removed clutter from main Dev-Agency directory
- Preserved session history for potential future reference
- Improved directory organization for developers
- Follows proper archival practices with reason documentation
