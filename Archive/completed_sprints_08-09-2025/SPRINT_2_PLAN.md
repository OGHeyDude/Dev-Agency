# Sprint 2 Plan - Dev-Agency
**Sprint Dates**: 08-10-2025 to 08-24-2025  
**Sprint Goal**: Build essential developer tools and expand recipe library using parallel agent execution  
**Target Points**: 23 points

## Sprint Strategy: Maximum Parallel Execution

### Agent Orchestration Plan
Using our **Full Stack Feature Recipe** pattern, we'll execute work in 4 phases with strategic parallelization:

1. **Phase 1: Parallel Architecture & Planning** (Days 1-2)
   - 3-4 agents working simultaneously on specs
2. **Phase 2: Parallel Implementation** (Days 3-7) 
   - 2-3 agents implementing different tickets
3. **Phase 3: Parallel QA** (Days 8-10)
   - 5 agents: tester, security, performance, clutter-detector, integration
4. **Phase 4: Documentation & Sync** (Days 11-12)
   - 2 agents: documenter, memory-sync

## Selected Tickets (23 Points Total)

### Tier 1: Critical Tools (13 points)
| ID | Ticket | Points | Dependencies | Agent Assignment |
|----|--------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| AGENT-010 | Context size optimizer tool | 5 | None | architect → coder → tester |
| AGENT-013 | Agent invocation CLI tool | 5 | None | architect → coder → integration |
| AGENT-011 | Agent selection assistant | 3 | AGENT-013 | architect → coder → tester |

### Tier 2: Recipe Expansion (7 points)
| ID | Ticket | Points | Dependencies | Agent Assignment |
|----|--------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| AGENT-009 | MCP implementation recipe | 3 | None | mcp-dev → documenter |
| AGENT-008 | Security audit workflow | 2 | None | security → documenter |
| AGENT-015 | Microservices recipe | 2 | None | integration → documenter |

### Tier 3: Foundation (3 points)
| ID | Ticket | Points | Dependencies | Agent Assignment |
|----|--------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| AGENT-005 | Feedback loops process | 3 | All above | architect → documenter |

## Parallel Execution Schedule

### Days 1-2: Architecture & Specs (Parallel Phase)
**Parallel Group 1** (5 agents max):
```
/agent:architect (AGENT-010 spec)
/agent:architect (AGENT-013 spec)  
/agent:architect (AGENT-011 spec)
/agent:mcp-dev (AGENT-009 planning)
/agent:security (AGENT-008 planning)
```

### Days 3-5: Implementation Wave 1 (Parallel Phase)
**Parallel Group 2** (3 agents):
```
/agent:coder (AGENT-010 - Context optimizer)
/agent:coder (AGENT-013 - CLI tool)
/agent:mcp-dev (AGENT-009 - MCP recipe)
```

### Days 6-7: Implementation Wave 2 (Parallel Phase)
**Parallel Group 3** (4 agents):
```
/agent:coder (AGENT-011 - Selection assistant)
/agent:security (AGENT-008 - Security workflow)
/agent:integration (AGENT-015 - Microservices)
/agent:architect (AGENT-005 - Feedback loops)
```

### Days 8-10: Quality Assurance (Maximum Parallel)
**Parallel Group 4** (5 agents):
```
/agent:tester (All implemented code)
/agent:security (Security review all)
/agent:performance (Performance validation)
/agent:clutter-detector (Anti-redundancy check)
/agent:integration (System integration tests)
```

### Days 11-12: Documentation & Memory Sync
**Parallel Group 5** (2 agents):
```
/agent:documenter (All documentation)
/agent:memory-sync (Knowledge graph update)
```

## Recipe Application Strategy

### Using Our Recipes
1. **Full Stack Feature Recipe**: For AGENT-010, AGENT-013, AGENT-011
2. **Performance Optimization Recipe**: For AGENT-010 specifically
3. **TDD Development Recipe**: For critical components
4. **Memory Sync Recipe**: End of sprint comprehensive sync

### Parallel Execution Benefits
- **Time Savings**: 40% reduction through parallelization
- **Quality**: Multiple agents reviewing simultaneously
- **Knowledge Capture**: Continuous memory sync
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early detection through parallel QA

## Risk Management

### Dependencies
- AGENT-011 depends on AGENT-013 (CLI tool first)
- AGENT-005 synthesizes learnings from all other tickets

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Token Limits**: Optimize context per agent
2. **Resource Contention**: Stagger CPU-intensive operations
3. **Integration Conflicts**: Daily integration tests
4. **Quality Gates**: No progression without passing tests

## Success Criteria

### Sprint Completion
- [ ] All 23 points delivered
- [ ] 100% test coverage on new tools
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Memory graph updated
- [ ] All recipes tested in production

### Quality Metrics
- Agent invocation success rate >90%
- Context optimization achieving 30% reduction
- CLI tool operational and documented
- Zero critical bugs in production

## Daily Execution Plan

### Day 1-2: Planning Blitz
- Morning: Launch 5 parallel architect agents
- Afternoon: Review and refine specs
- Evening: Prepare implementation contexts

### Day 3-5: Implementation Sprint
- Continuous parallel coding
- Daily integration checks
- Progressive feature completion

### Day 6-7: Feature Completion
- Complete remaining implementations
- Initial testing and debugging
- Prepare for QA phase

### Day 8-10: Quality Marathon
- Launch all 5 QA agents simultaneously
- Address findings in real-time
- Performance optimization

### Day 11-12: Documentation & Release

## Agent Resource Allocation

### Peak Parallel Usage
- **Maximum**: 5 agents simultaneously (system limit)
- **Average**: 3 agents in parallel
- **Sequential**: Only where dependencies require

### Token Budget
- Estimated: 500K tokens for parallel execution
- Optimization: Context sharing between related agents
- Monitoring: Daily token usage tracking

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups
- Review parallel agent progress
- Identify blockers
- Adjust execution plan

### Agent Coordination
- Main Claude as orchestrator
- No agent-to-agent communication
- Centralized context management

## Commit Strategy

### Progressive Commits
- Day 5: First wave implementation
- Day 7: Second wave implementation  
- Day 10: QA fixes and improvements
- Day 12: Final release commit

### Memory Sync Points
- After each commit
- End of sprint comprehensive sync
- Pattern extraction for future use
