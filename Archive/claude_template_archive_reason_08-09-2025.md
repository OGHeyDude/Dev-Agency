# Archive Reason: Duplicate CLAUDE Template

**File Archived:** CLAUDE_Template.md (from Development_Standards/Templates/)  
**Date Archived:** 08-09-2025  
**Reason:** Duplicate/outdated template - replaced by PROJECT_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md  

## Details
This template was the old version with incorrect paths and copy-based approach. It has been superseded by PROJECT_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md which implements the centralized reference-only approach.

## Migration
Users should now use: `/home/hd/Desktop/LAB/Dev-Agency/PROJECT_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`

## Key Differences
- Old: Required copying files to projects
- New: References Dev-Agency centrally (no copying)
