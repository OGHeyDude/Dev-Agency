# Archive Reason: Duplicate Recipe Files

**Date**: 08-09-2025
**Ticket**: AGENT-003
**Archived By**: Claude

## Files Archived
1. `complex_refactoring_recipe.md`
2. `tdd_development_recipe.md`
3. `database_migration_recipe.md`

## Reason for Archival
These files were created as part of AGENT-003 but were found to be duplicates of existing recipe files:
- `complex_refactoring_recipe.md` duplicated `complex_refactoring_workflow.md`
- `tdd_development_recipe.md` duplicated `tdd_development_cycle_recipe.md`
- `database_migration_recipe.md` duplicated `database_migration_workflow.md`

## Action Taken
Following the Anti-Clutter Principle and Single Source of Truth directive, these duplicate files were archived. The existing files with "_workflow" suffix were retained as they were created first.

## Recommendation
The original files contain comprehensive content and should be used as the single source of truth for these recipes.

## New Unique Recipes Created
Successfully created 2 unique recipes that add value:
1. `full_stack_feature_recipe.md` - Complete feature development workflow
2. `performance_optimization_recipe.md` - Performance bottleneck resolution

These 2 recipes are unique and provide new agent combination patterns not covered by existing recipes.
