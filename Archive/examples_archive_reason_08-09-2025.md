# Archive Reason: Examples Directory

**Directory Archived:** /examples/

**Reason:** Redundant demonstration - PROJECT_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md serves as the reference  

## Details
The examples/test-project was a demonstration of how to use the centralized system. This is redundant because:
1. PROJECT_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md provides the actual template
2. Examples create confusion vs templates
3. Not needed for the central system to function

## Contents Archived
- test-project/CLAUDE.md - Example of filled template
- test-project/README.md - Demo documentation

## What to Use Instead
Use `/Development_Standards/Templates/PROJECT_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md` as the reference for setting up new projects.

## Note
The template is self-documenting and doesn't need separate examples.
