# Agent Prompt Templates

## Overview

This document provides standardized prompt templates for invoking specialized agents. Each template demonstrates how to pre-process context and embed necessary information directly into agent prompts.

## Core Principles

### 1. Complete Context
Every agent prompt must be self-contained with all necessary information.

### 2. No External References
Never use references like `$STANDARDS` or file paths - include the actual content.

### 3. Clear Success Criteria
Always specify what constitutes successful completion.

### 4. Examples When Possible
Include examples from the existing codebase to guide the agent.

## Context Passing Between Agents

### Sequential Context Building

When agents work in sequence, each agent's output becomes part of the next agent's context:

```
## Previous Agent Output
[Previous agent's complete output]

## Your Task
Building on the above [architecture/implementation/test results], [specific task].
```

### Parallel Agent Context

When running agents in parallel, provide the same base context to each:

```
## Shared Context
[Common information all agents need]

## Your Specific Focus
[Agent-specific task within the shared context]
```

## Error Context Template

When an agent encounters an error or partial completion:

```
## Error Context
Previous Attempt:
\```
[What was tried]
\```

Error Encountered:
\```
[Error message/stack trace]
\```

## Recovery Task
[What needs to be fixed or alternative approach]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Context Size Management
- Include only relevant code sections
- Summarize large documents to key points
- Use examples instead of entire files

### 2. Clear Boundaries
- Specify what the agent should NOT do
- Define scope clearly
- Set clear stopping points

### 3. Output Format
- Always specify expected output format
- Include examples of desired output
- Define success criteria clearly

### 4. Iterative Refinement
- Start with essential context
- Add details based on agent performance
- Track what context improves outcomes
