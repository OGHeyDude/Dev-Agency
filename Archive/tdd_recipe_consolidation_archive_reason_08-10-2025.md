# Archive Reason: TDD Recipe Consolidation

**Date:** 08-10-2025  
**Archived File:** `tdd_development_cycle_recipe.md`  
**Reason:** Recipe consolidation to eliminate redundancy

## Details
- Two TDD recipes existed with overlapping content:
  - `tdd_development_cycle_recipe.md` (created 08-09-2025)
  - `tdd_workflow_recipe.md` (created 08-10-2025)
  
- The newer `tdd_workflow_recipe.md` is more comprehensive with:
  - API/Frontend/Microservice variations
  - CI/CD integration examples
  - Detailed test patterns and anti-patterns
  - Complete 9-phase workflow

## Migration Notes
- All functionality from this recipe is covered in `tdd_workflow_recipe.md`
- Users should reference `/recipes/tdd_workflow_recipe.md` going forward
- No functionality lost in this consolidation
