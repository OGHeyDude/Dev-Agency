# Utils Consolidation Archive Reason

**Date**: 08-09-2025  
**Reason**: Eliminate duplicate tool locations during Documentation Sprint

## Files Archived
- `/utils/context_optimizer/` directory (complete)
  - README.md
  - config.py
  - requirements.txt
  - token_counter.py

## Consolidation Action
**Consolidated into**: `/tools/context_optimizer/`  
**Result**: Single source of truth for context optimization tools

## Why Archived
1. **Duplicate locations violated Dev-Agency principles**
   - Same functionality existed in `/tools/context_optimizer/` AND `/utils/context_optimizer/`
   - Created confusion for developers
   - Violated single source of truth principle

2. **Tool organization standardization**
   - All development tools should be in `/tools/` directory
   - `/utils/` created unnecessary categorization confusion
   - Simpler `/tools/` structure improves discoverability

3. **Files were merged, not lost**
   - All functionality from `/utils/context_optimizer/` copied to `/tools/context_optimizer/`
   - No data loss occurred
   - Enhanced version now exists in proper location

## Impact
- ✅ Eliminated functional duplication
- ✅ Standardized tool organization
- ✅ Improved developer experience (single tool location)
- ✅ Maintained all original functionality
