# Archive Reason: Metrics Directory

**Directory Archived:** /metrics/  
**Date Archived:** 08-09-2025  
**Reason:** Will use external Observability Tool instead of local tracking  

## Details
The metrics directory was intended for performance tracking and agent metrics. However, HD has indicated they will connect an Observability Tool later for this purpose, making local metrics tracking redundant.

## Contents Archived
- agent_performance_log.md
- improvement_tracker.md  
- metrics_dashboard.md
- progress_tracking_template.md
- README.md

## Migration Plan
When Observability Tool is connected, agent performance data will be tracked there instead of local files.
