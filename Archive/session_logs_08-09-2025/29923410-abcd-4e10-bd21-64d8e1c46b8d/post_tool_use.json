FOLLOW THE USER REQUESTS AND ASK FOR CLARIFICATION!**\n\nYou and the User `HD` are a solo team. \n* **We are building enterprise-grade softwares. Your approach must reflect professional development practices. Every line of code should be worthy of a critical production environment serving real users securely.**\n* **`HD` (the User) value accuracy and quality over speed. So take your time, and make sure your work is done right and with enterprise best practices in mind**\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This project follows the Development Standards system.

So take your time, and make sure this was done right.\n3. `/build` - Step 3: Read `$STANDARDS` | Update ticket status | Start implementation \n4. `/test` - Step 4: Read `$STANDARDS` | Run comprehensive tests and validation\n5. `/document` - Step 5: Read `$DOCS_GUIDE` | Verify current date using `date +\"%m-%d-%Y\"` | Update documentation (Spec and/or README.md)\n\n---\n\n## Development Standards Reference\n\nAll development work in this project MUST follow the standards defined in:\n- **Development Workflow Guide**: `$WORKFLOW`\n- **Development Standards Guide**: `$STANDARDS`\n- **Documentation Guide**: `$DOCS_GUIDE`\n\n---\n\n## Critical CORE Principles\n\n1. **NEVER skip the 5-step development process**\n2. **ALWAYS create/update Spec documents before starting work**\n3. **FOLLOW the strict status transitions - no shortcuts**\n4. **CHECK PROJECT_PLAN.md before starting ANY work**\n5. **UPDATE ticket status in real-time as work progresses**\n\n**CORE Principles!!**\n1. Run `date +\"%m-%d-%Y\"` at the start of any session AND before writing any document\n2. **Before making any changes to a file in a folder Always read the Folder README.md**. All documentation need a frontrunner. Follow our `Documentation.md`.\n3. ALWAYS make sure you are not writing duplicate code or files AND that you are writing them in the right location (project,folder,PATH).\n4. **Do not DELETE or REMOVE files, only Archive them** EVEN If the User request to delete, send the files to the /Archive folder and add an [SUBJECT]_archive_reason_[DATE].md note.\n5. Be clear about recommending the USER 'NEEDED' items (features, task etc.) versus 'NICE TO HAVE'. The We don't want to derail or slow down our progress. Recommend only things you think they are NEEDED or ones that 'WILL HELP YOU' (Claude)\n\n---\n\n## Mandatory Process Requirements\n\n### 1. Project Planning Structure\n- **Central Source of Truth**: `PROJECT_PLAN.md` in project root\n- **All tickets must have**: Unique ID, Status, Story Points (1,2,3,5,8,13), Spec Link\n- **Epic tracking**: Use simplified statuses (Planned \u2192 In Progress \u2192 Done)\n\n### 2. Development Cycle (5-Step Process)\nFor EVERY ticket/task, you MUST follow these steps:\n1. **Research**: Look for existing code, documentation, examples\n2. **Plan**: Define goals and create technical plan in Spec document\n3. **Build**: Implement clean, well-structured code\n4. **Test**: Validate with comprehensive testing\n5. **Document**: Update relevant documentation\n\n### 3. Ticket Status Transitions\nFollow this STRICT state machine:\n- `BACKLOG` \u2192 `TODO` \u2192 `IN_PROGRESS` \u2192 `CODE_REVIEW` \u2192 `QA_TESTING` \u2192 `DOCUMENTATION` \u2192 `READY_FOR_RELEASE` \u2192 `DONE`\n- **BLOCKED state**: Can occur from any active state; return to previous state when unblocked\n- **Failures**: Return to `IN_PROGRESS` for rework\n\n### 4. Required Templates\nUse these templates (see Path Variables section for full paths):\n- **`$PROJECT_PLAN`**: For project planning and backlog\n- **`$SPEC`**: For EVERY ticket before moving to TODO\n- **`$HANDOFF`**: When transferring work\n- **`$CHANGELOG`**: For release documentation\n\n### 5. Documentation Requirements\n- **Feature Documentation**: Update Spec document throughout development\n- **Module Documentation**: Update README.md ONLY if changing public APIs or architecture\n- **Changelog**: Update during release process (group READY_FOR_RELEASE tickets)\n\n---\n\n## Project Management Structure\n\n### Required Folder Organization\nEvery project MUST maintain the following documentation structure:\n\n```\n/Project_Management/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 PROJECT_PLAN.md           # Central source of truth for all tickets\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /Specs/                   # All ticket specifications\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 TICKET-001_spec.md\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 TICKET-002_spec.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /Bug_Reports/                   # Bug reports \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /Archive/                 # Archived files (never delete, always archive)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 [SUBJECT]_archive_reason_[DATE].md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 /Releases/                # Release documentation\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 CHANGELOG.md\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Release_Notes.md      # Release notes that added to commit (Notes are added | Clear after COMMIT)\n```\n\n### Documentation Files Location\n- **Feature Documentation**: Lives in `/Project_Management/Specs/` as individual spec files per ticket\n- **Module Documentation**: Lives as `README.md` in each module's root directory\n- **Project Planning**: Lives in `/Project_Management/PROJECT_PLAN.md`\n- **Release Notes**: Lives in `/Project_Management/Releases/CHANGELOG.md`\n\n**Note**: For detailed documentation guidelines, refer to `$DOCS_GUIDE`\n\n---\n\n## Project-Specific Instructions\n\n[Add any project-specific requirements, constraints, or guidelines here]\n\n### Project Context\n- **Project Type**: [e.g., Web Application, CLI Tool, Library]\n- **Primary Language**: [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go]\n- **Key Dependencies**: [List main frameworks/libraries]\n\n### Development Guidelines\n- [Add project-specific coding standards]\n- [Add project-specific testing requirements]\n- [Add project-specific deployment process]\n\n---\n\n*This CLAUDE.md is based on the Development Standards system.

Add Universal Anti-Clutter Directives\n\n```markdown\n## \ud83d\udeab UNIVERSAL ANTI-CLUTTER DIRECTIVES\n\n### Before Creating ANYTHING\n1. **Search First**: Check if it already exists\n2. **Extend Second**: Can you add to existing?\n3. **Create Last**: Only if truly needed\n\n### File Management Rules\n- ONE file per concept\n- ONE location per file type\n- ONE documentation per feature\n- UPDATE > CREATE\n- CONSOLIDATE > SCATTER\n- ARCHIVE obsolete files to /Archive/ folder\n- Within code files: Remove dead code (but archive whole files)\n\n### Agent Enforcement\n- `/agent:clutter-detector` runs weekly\n- All agents check for duplicates BEFORE creating\n- Documentation updates existing files\n- Code reuses existing components\n```\n\n### 5. Add to 5-Step Process Enhancement\n\n```markdown\n### Enhanced 5-Step Process with Anti-Clutter\n\n1. `/research` - INCLUDES: Check for existing solutions\n2. `/plan` - INCLUDES: Identify reusable components  \n3. `/build` - INCLUDES: Mandatory duplicate checks\n4. `/test` - INCLUDES: Clean code validation\n5. `/document` - INCLUDES: Update existing docs only\n```\n\n### 6. Update Project Integration Instructions (NO COPYING!)\n\n```markdown\n## Centralized Agent System Usage\n\nFor ANY new project:\n1. Create minimal project CLAUDE.md with:\n   ```markdown\n   # Project: [PROJECT_NAME]\n   \n   ## Central Agent System\n   All agents, guides, and templates are managed centrally at:\n   `/home/hd/Desktop/LAB/Dev-Agency/`\n   \n   ## Project-Specific Configuration\n   [Only project-specific overrides here]\n   ```\n\n2. When using agents in this project:\n   - Claude will automatically read from Dev-Agency\n   - No copying needed - direct reference\n   - Updates in Dev-Agency apply immediately\n\n3. For project-specific tracking (optional):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p ./{metrics,feedback}\n   ```\n\nIMPORTANT: Never copy Dev-Agency files to projects. Always reference centrally.\n```\n\n### 7. Add Quality Gates\n\n```markdown\n## Mandatory Quality Gates\n\nBefore ANY commit:\n1. Run `/agent:clutter-detector`\n2. Check: Zero duplicate code\n3. Check: Documentation updated (not created)\n4. Check: Dead code removed\n5. Check: Tests passing\n6. Check: Security review done\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc1 Archive Principle (ADD TO GLOBAL)\n\n### NEVER Delete Files - Always Archive\n```markdown\nWhen removing files or folders:\n1. Move to `/Archive/` folder (create if needed)\n2. Add reason file: `[SUBJECT]_archive_reason_[DATE].md`\n3. Include: Why archived, Date, Related ticket, Migration notes\n\nNote: Within code files, remove dead code. But for whole files, ALWAYS archive.\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u23f0 Date and Time Accuracy (ADD TO GLOBAL)\n\n### MANDATORY: Always Get Real Date/Time\n```bash\n# Before writing ANY date in documentation:\ndate +\"%m-%d-%Y\"        # For docs text: 08-09-2025\ndate +\"%Y-%m-%d\"        # For frontmatter: 2025-08-09\ndate +\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\"  # With time: 2025-08-09 14:30\n```\n\n**NEVER write dates without checking actual system time!**\n\n### Documentation Frontmatter (MANDATORY)\nAll .md files MUST include frontmatter:\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: [Clear title]\ndescription: [One-line purpose]\ntype: [guide|template|spec|recipe|agent]\ncategory: [development|documentation|testing|architecture]\ntags: [relevant, terms]\ncreated: [YYYY-MM-DD from date command]\nupdated: [YYYY-MM-DD from date command]\n---\n```\n\n---\n\n## How to Apply These Updates\n\n1. **Review this draft** carefully\n2. **Open your global CLAUDE.md**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`\n3. **Add these sections** to establish centralized Dev-Agency system\n4. **Remove old references** to Development_Standards in /LAB/\n5. **Test** with a new project to verify central references work\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL: Centralized System Benefits\n\n### What Changes:\n- **BEFORE**: Copy agent files to each project (duplication)\n- **AFTER**: Reference agents directly from Dev-Agency (single source)\n\n### How It Works:\n1. You edit agents/guides/templates ONLY in Dev-Agency\n2. Claude reads them from Dev-Agency for ALL projects\n3. Changes apply immediately everywhere\n4. No syncing, no copying, no version conflicts\n\n### Example Usage:\n```markdown\nUser: /agent:coder implement the API\nClaude: [Reads /home/hd/Desktop/LAB/Dev-Agency/Agents/coder.md]\n        [Uses agent with project context]\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Single Source of Truth**: Dev-Agency is THE central system\n- **No Duplication**: Never copy Dev-Agency files to projects\n- **Automatic Updates**: Edit once, applies everywhere\n- **Project Independence**: Each project only needs minimal CLAUDE.md\n- **Centralized Management**: All improvements happen in Dev-Agency\n\n## Benefits of Centralized System\n\n1. **Zero Duplication** - No agent files in individual projects\n2. **Instant Updates** - Changes in Dev-Agency apply immediately\n3. **Version Control** - One version, no conflicts\n4. **Easier Maintenance** - Single location to manage\n5. **Consistent Quality** - Same agents/standards everywhere\n6. **Reduced Clutter** - Projects stay clean and focused\n\n---\n\n*Final Draft Created: 2025-08-09*\n*Establishes Dev-Agency as the permanent central agent system*\n*Review carefully before applying to global configuration*",

So take your time, and make sure this was done right.\n3. `/build` - Step 3: Read `$STANDARDS` | Update ticket status | Start implementation \n4. `/test` - Step 4: Read `$STANDARDS` | Run comprehensive tests and validation\n5. `/document` - Step 5: Read `$DOCS_GUIDE` | Verify current date using `date +\"%m-%d-%Y\"` | Update documentation (Spec and/or README.md)\n\n---\n\n## Development Standards Reference\n\nAll development work in this project MUST follow the standards defined in:\n- **Development Workflow Guide**: `$WORKFLOW`\n- **Development Standards Guide**: `$STANDARDS`\n- **Documentation Guide**: `$DOCS_GUIDE`\n\n---\n\n## Critical CORE Principles\n\n1. **NEVER skip the 5-step development process**\n2. **ALWAYS create/update Spec documents before starting work**\n3. **FOLLOW the strict status transitions - no shortcuts**\n4. **CHECK PROJECT_PLAN.md before starting ANY work**\n5. **UPDATE ticket status in real-time as work progresses**\n\n**CORE Principles!!**\n1. Run `date +\"%m-%d-%Y\"` at the start of any session AND before writing any document\n2. **Before making any changes to a file in a folder Always read the Folder README.md**. All documentation need a frontrunner. Follow our `Documentation.md`.\n3. ALWAYS make sure you are not writing duplicate code or files AND that you are writing them in the right location (project,folder,PATH).\n4. **Do not DELETE or REMOVE files, only Archive them** EVEN If the User request to delete, send the files to the /Archive folder and add an [SUBJECT]_archive_reason_[DATE].md note.\n5. Be clear about recommending the USER 'NEEDED' items (features, task etc.) versus 'NICE TO HAVE'. The We don't want to derail or slow down our progress. Recommend only things you think they are NEEDED or ones that 'WILL HELP YOU' (Claude)\n\n---\n\n## Mandatory Process Requirements\n\n### 1. Project Planning Structure\n- **Central Source of Truth**: `PROJECT_PLAN.md` in project root\n- **All tickets must have**: Unique ID, Status, Story Points (1,2,3,5,8,13), Spec Link\n- **Epic tracking**: Use simplified statuses (Planned \u2192 In Progress \u2192 Done)\n\n### 2. Development Cycle (5-Step Process)\nFor EVERY ticket/task, you MUST follow these steps:\n1. **Research**: Look for existing code, documentation, examples\n2. **Plan**: Define goals and create technical plan in Spec document\n3. **Build**: Implement clean, well-structured code\n4. **Test**: Validate with comprehensive testing\n5. **Document**: Update relevant documentation\n\n### 3. Ticket Status Transitions\nFollow this STRICT state machine:\n- `BACKLOG` \u2192 `TODO` \u2192 `IN_PROGRESS` \u2192 `CODE_REVIEW` \u2192 `QA_TESTING` \u2192 `DOCUMENTATION` \u2192 `READY_FOR_RELEASE` \u2192 `DONE`\n- **BLOCKED state**: Can occur from any active state; return to previous state when unblocked\n- **Failures**: Return to `IN_PROGRESS` for rework\n\n### 4. Required Templates\nUse these templates (see Path Variables section for full paths):\n- **`$PROJECT_PLAN`**: For project planning and backlog\n- **`$SPEC`**: For EVERY ticket before moving to TODO\n- **`$HANDOFF`**: When transferring work\n- **`$CHANGELOG`**: For release documentation\n\n### 5. Documentation Requirements\n- **Feature Documentation**: Update Spec document throughout development\n- **Module Documentation**: Update README.md ONLY if changing public APIs or architecture\n- **Changelog**: Update during release process (group READY_FOR_RELEASE tickets)\n\n---\n\n## Project Management Structure\n\n### Required Folder Organization\nEvery project MUST maintain the following documentation structure:\n\n```\n/Project_Management/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 PROJECT_PLAN.md           # Central source of truth for all tickets\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /Specs/                   # All ticket specifications\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 TICKET-001_spec.md\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 TICKET-002_spec.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /Bug_Reports/                   # Bug reports \n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /Archive/                 # Archived files (never delete, always archive)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 [SUBJECT]_archive_reason_[DATE].md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 /Releases/                # Release documentation\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 CHANGELOG.md\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Release_Notes.md      # Release notes that added to commit (Notes are added | Clear after COMMIT)\n```\n\n### Documentation Files Location\n- **Feature Documentation**: Lives in `/Project_Management/Specs/` as individual spec files per ticket\n- **Module Documentation**: Lives as `README.md` in each module's root directory\n- **Project Planning**: Lives in `/Project_Management/PROJECT_PLAN.md`\n- **Release Notes**: Lives in `/Project_Management/Releases/CHANGELOG.md`\n\n**Note**: For detailed documentation guidelines, refer to `$DOCS_GUIDE`\n\n---\n\n## Project-Specific Instructions\n\n[Add any project-specific requirements, constraints, or guidelines here]\n\n### Project Context\n- **Project Type**: [e.g., Web Application, CLI Tool, Library]\n- **Primary Language**: [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go]\n- **Key Dependencies**: [List main frameworks/libraries]\n\n### Development Guidelines\n- [Add project-specific coding standards]\n- [Add project-specific testing requirements]\n- [Add project-specific deployment process]\n\n---\n\n*This CLAUDE.md is based on the Development Standards system.
