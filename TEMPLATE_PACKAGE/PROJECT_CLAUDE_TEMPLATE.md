## ðŸŽ¯ Central Dev-Agency System

**All agents, guides, templates, and development standards are managed centrally at:**
`/home/hd/Desktop/LAB/Dev-Agency/`

**NEVER COPY these files to this project!** The system works by reference:
1. Agent commands automatically read from Dev-Agency
2. Templates are used directly from Dev-Agency  
3. Standards are referenced from Dev-Agency

Single source of truth = Edit once in Dev-Agency, applies everywhere instantly.
