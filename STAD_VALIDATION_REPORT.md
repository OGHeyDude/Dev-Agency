## ⚠️ Limitations Discovered

### 1. **GitHub Project Board CLI** ❌
- **Issue:** Auth scope prevents `gh project create`
- **Workaround:** Manual web UI creation documented
- **Impact:** Minor - one-time manual step per sprint
- **Documentation:** Complete guide created

### 2. **Worktree Directory Access** ❌
- **Issue:** Security prevents `cd` to worktree paths
- **Workaround:** Work in main directory, merge branches
- **Impact:** Medium - parallel execution limited
- **Alternative:** Sequential batch execution works fine

### 3. **Token Usage Reduction** ⚠️
- **Target:** 90% reduction
- **Achieved:** ~60% reduction (estimate)
- **Issue:** No large sprint to measure accurately
- **Note:** AGENT-027 was already complete, limiting measurement

### 4. **Existing Work Discovery** ⚠️
- **Issue:** AGENT-027 was 100% complete from Sprint 6
- **Impact:** Sprint 7 became validation-only
- **Learning:** Always check existing implementations first
- **Benefit:** Proved our existing system works well
