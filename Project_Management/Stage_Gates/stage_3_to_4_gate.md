- No security issues

### Human Review Record
Location: GitHub Issue comments

Must include:
- Reviewer identity
- Testing performed
- Issues found (if any)
- Approval statement
- Conditions (if any)

### Performance Validation
```yaml
performance_criteria:
  response_time:
    p50: <100ms
    p95: <200ms
    p99: <500ms
  
  throughput:
    minimum: 1000 req/sec
    sustained: 500 req/sec
  
  resource_usage:
    cpu: <70%
    memory: <1GB
    disk_io: <100MB/s
  
  error_rate:
    5xx: <0.1%
    4xx: <1%
    timeouts: <0.5%
```

### Security Validation
```yaml
security_requirements:
  vulnerabilities:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: <3
    low: acceptable
  
  compliance:
    owasp_top_10: passed
    authentication: enforced
    authorization: verified
    encryption: enabled
  
  audit:
    penetration_test: passed (if required)
    code_review: completed
    dependency_scan: clean
```

## Release Preparation

### Deployment Package
```yaml
deployment_ready:
  artifacts:
    - build: /dist/
    - config: /config/production.yml
    - scripts: /scripts/deploy.sh
    - rollback: /scripts/rollback.sh
  
  validation:
    - health_check: /health endpoint
    - smoke_tests: /tests/smoke/
    - monitoring: DataDog|NewRelic|CloudWatch
  
  documentation:
    - release_notes: Version changes
    - runbook: Operational procedures
    - contacts: On-call information
```

### Pre-Release Checklist
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Cache warming completed
- [ ] CDN configuration updated
- [ ] DNS changes prepared
- [ ] Load balancer configured

### Release Communication
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled
- [ ] Support team briefed
- [ ] Documentation published
- [ ] Marketing informed (if applicable)

## Gate Validation Process

### Final Validation Suite
```bash
# Production simulation test
npm run test:production

# Performance validation
npm run benchmark:production

# Security final scan
npm run security:final

# Deployment dry run
npm run deploy:dry-run

# All must pass before release
```

### Approval Workflow
1. **Backend QA Approval**
   - Automated tests pass
   - Manual validation complete
   - Sign-off received

2. **Human Review Approval**
   - Functional testing done
   - UX validation complete
   - `/approve` command issued

3. **Technical Approval**
   - Security review passed
   - Performance validated
   - Architecture approved

## Decision Matrix

| Validation Result | Action | Next Step |
|------------------|--------|-----------|
| All Approved | **RELEASE** | Proceed to Stage 4 |
| Minor Issues | **CONDITIONAL** | Fix in next sprint |
| Major Issues | **BLOCKED** | Return to Stage 2 |
| Critical Issues | **ABORT** | Stop and replan |

## Common Blockers

### Validation Failures
| Issue | Impact | Resolution |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Performance regression | High | Optimize before release |
| Security vulnerability | Critical | Fix immediately |
| Functional bug | Medium | Assess and fix/defer |
| Documentation gaps | Low | Complete before release |

### Approval Delays
| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Stakeholder unavailable | Schedule conflict | Delegate approval |
| Testing incomplete | Time constraints | Extend validation |
| Requirements unclear | Scope creep | Clarify and retest |
| Integration issues | External dependency | Coordinate fix |

## Release Criteria

### Go/No-Go Decision
```yaml
release_decision:
  go_criteria:
    - all_tests: PASS
    - approvals: RECEIVED
    - risks: ACCEPTABLE
    - rollback: READY
  
  no_go_triggers:
    - critical_bug: Found
    - security_issue: Unresolved
    - performance: Below SLA

  conditional_release:
    - feature_flag: Enabled
    - limited_rollout: 10% users
    - monitoring: Enhanced
    - support: On standby
```

### Release Window
