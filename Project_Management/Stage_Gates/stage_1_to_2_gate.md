# Stage Gate: Stage 1 → Stage 2

## Gate Purpose
Ensure comprehensive planning is complete with all context needed for zero-intervention autonomous execution.

## Mandatory Criteria (All Must Pass)

### ✅ Technical Specifications
- [ ] All tickets have complete specifications
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Implementation approach documented
- [ ] API contracts specified (if applicable)
- [ ] Database changes defined (if applicable)

### ✅ Ticket Management
- [ ] No ticket exceeds 5 story points
- [ ] All tickets created on GitHub
- [ ] Tickets added to Project board
- [ ] Dependencies clearly marked
- [ ] Total sprint points: 30-35

### ✅ Execution Plan
- [ ] Dependency graph (DAG) created
- [ ] Execution batches defined
- [ ] Parallel opportunities identified
- [ ] Critical path determined
- [ ] Context packages prepared per batch

### ✅ Edge Case Preparation
- [ ] Common edge cases documented
- [ ] Handling strategies defined
- [ ] Fallback approaches specified
- [ ] Error scenarios covered
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented

### ✅ Decision Completeness
- [ ] All architectural decisions made
- [ ] Technology choices finalized
- [ ] No ambiguous requirements
- [ ] Design patterns selected
- [ ] Integration approaches defined

## Critical Quality Checks

### 🔍 Specification Quality
Each ticket specification must include:
- Problem statement
- Solution approach
- Implementation details
- Test criteria
- Documentation needs

### 🔍 Context Package Validation
Each context package must contain:
- Files to read (with exact paths)
- Patterns to follow (with examples)
- Dependencies available
- Decisions already made
- Edge case handlers

### 🔍 Dependency Analysis
- No circular dependencies
- Clear execution order
- Shared resources identified
- Blocking dependencies marked
- Parallel paths validated

## Gate Validation Process

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Verify all tickets have specs
for ticket in $(gh issue list --label sprint-9 --json number -q '.[].number'); do
  test -f "Project_Management/Specs/STAD-${ticket}_spec.md" || exit 1
done

# Check no ticket >5 points
gh project item-list 9 --format json | \
  jq '.items[].story_points' | \
  awk '$1 > 5 {exit 1}'

# Verify execution plan exists
test -f "Project_Management/Sprint_Plans/Sprint_9_plan.md" || exit 1

# Validate DAG has no cycles
./scripts/validate-dag.sh || exit 1
```

### Manual Review Checklist
1. **Specification Review**
   - Complete and unambiguous?
   - Testable criteria?
   - Performance requirements?

2. **Plan Review**
   - Dependencies logical?
   - Batches well-organized?
   - Resources adequate?

3. **Risk Review**
   - Edge cases covered?
   - Fallbacks reasonable?
   - Recovery possible?

## Gate Decision Matrix

| Criteria Met | Action | Next Step |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| All Mandatory + Clean DAG | **PROCEED** | Start Stage 2 execution |
| Minor Issues (<3) | **FIX AND PROCEED** | Quick fixes, then start |
| Specification Gaps | **BLOCKED** | Return to specification |
| Dependency Issues | **REPLAN** | Revise execution plan |

## Common Validation Failures

### Specification Issues
| Issue | Detection | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Ambiguous requirements | Review finding | Clarify with stakeholder |
| Missing test criteria | Validation check | Add acceptance tests |
| No error handling | Code review | Define error strategies |
| Incomplete API spec | Contract validation | Complete API design |

### Planning Issues
| Issue | Detection | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Ticket too large | Point check | Split into sub-tickets |
| Circular dependency | DAG analysis | Restructure dependencies |
| Missing context | Package review | Add required context |
| No fallback strategy | Edge case review | Define fallbacks |

## Pre-Execution Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Feature branch created
- [ ] CI/CD configured
- [ ] Test environment ready
- [ ] Monitoring enabled
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

### Agent Preparation
- [ ] Agent assignments clear
- [ ] Context packages distributed
- [ ] Handoff templates ready
- [ ] Work report structure created
- [ ] Decision escalation path defined

### Automation Ready
- [ ] GitHub Actions configured
- [ ] Quality gates defined
- [ ] Auto-merge rules set
- [ ] Status update automation
- [ ] Notification hooks configured

## Gate Artifacts

### Required Outputs
1. **Complete Specifications**
   - Location: `/Project_Management/Specs/`
   - One per ticket

2. **Execution Plan with DAG**
   - Location: `/Project_Management/Sprint_Plans/Sprint_[N]_plan.md`
   - Must include dependency graph

3. **Context Packages**
   - Location: `/Project_Management/Context_Packages/Sprint_[N]/`
   - One per batch

4. **Edge Case Matrix**
   - Location: `/Project_Management/Sprint_Plans/Sprint_[N]_edge_cases.md`
   - All scenarios covered

### Success Metrics
- Gate validation time: <1 hour
- First-pass success rate: >90%
- Specification completeness: 100%
- Context package accuracy: >95%

## Stage 2 Handoff

### What Agents Receive
```yaml
stage_2_package:
  tickets:
    - id: STAD-001
      spec: /path/to/spec
      context: /path/to/context
      batch: 1
      dependencies: []
  
  execution_plan:
    batches:
      - batch_1: [STAD-001, STAD-002]  # Parallel
      - batch_2: [STAD-003]            # Depends on batch_1
  
  edge_cases:
    - scenario: API timeout
      strategy: Retry with backoff
      fallback: Return cached data
  
  decisions:
    architecture: Microservices
    database: PostgreSQL
    testing: Jest + React Testing Library
```

### Stage 2 Guarantees
With this gate passed, Stage 2 can execute with:
- Zero human intervention
- All decisions pre-made
- All context available
- All edge cases handled
- Clear success criteria

*This gate ensures Stage 2 can run autonomously without any clarifications*
