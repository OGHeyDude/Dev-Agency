| Learning system instability | Medium | Extensive testing, gradual rollout |
| Performance overhead | Medium | Benchmark continuously, optimize |
| Integration complexity | Low | Leverage existing architecture |

## Resource Allocation

### Agent Assignment
- **AGENT-033:** coder (primary), tester
- **AGENT-032:** architect (design), coder (implement)
- **AGENT-031:** architect (design), coder (implement), tester
- **AGENT-022:** architect (design), coder (complex), tester, performance

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
