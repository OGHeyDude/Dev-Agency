# **Spec: MCP Implementation Recipe**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-009`  
**Status:** `TODO`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-09  
**Story Points:** 3  

---

## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** MCP server implementation lacks standardized patterns, leading to inconsistent implementations and repeated mistakes. Developers need guidance on protocol compliance, testing strategies, and integration patterns.

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive recipe that guides developers through MCP server implementation using the mcp-dev agent, ensuring protocol compliance, proper testing, and production-ready deployment.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Recipe covers complete MCP server lifecycle
- [ ] Utilizes mcp-dev agent effectively throughout
- [ ] Includes protocol compliance validation
- [ ] Testing strategy with mock clients
- [ ] Documentation generation integrated
- [ ] Error handling patterns documented
- [ ] Performance optimization guidelines
- [ ] Integration with existing systems covered

## **3. Technical Plan**

### **Recipe Structure**

**Phase 1: Protocol Analysis**
- Use mcp-dev to analyze MCP specifications
- Define server capabilities and endpoints
- Plan data models and message formats

**Phase 2: Implementation**
- Server scaffold generation
- Protocol handler implementation
- State management design
- Error handling setup

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation**
- Protocol compliance testing
- Mock client interactions
- Performance benchmarking
- Security validation

**Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment**
- API documentation generation
- Deployment guide creation
- Integration examples

### **Agent Orchestration**

```
mcp-dev (lead) → architect (design) → coder (implement) → 
tester (validate) → documenter (finalize)
```

### **Key Patterns**

- Message validation and sanitization
- Async request handling
- Connection lifecycle management
- State synchronization
- Error recovery mechanisms
