# **Spec: Production Health Checks and Graceful Degradation**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-026`  
**Status:** `DONE`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-10  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Epic:** Production Readiness  
**Link to Project Plan:** [PROJECT_PLAN.md](../PROJECT_PLAN.md)

## **1. Problem & Goal**

* **Problem:** The Dev-Agency system lacks production-grade reliability mechanisms. When agents fail, are unavailable, or experience performance degradation, the system does not gracefully handle these failures, leading to poor user experience and system instability. There are no health check endpoints for monitoring system status, no circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures, and no fallback mechanisms when agents are unresponsive. This creates critical production reliability gaps that prevent enterprise deployment.

* **Goal:** Implement comprehensive health monitoring endpoints and intelligent fallback mechanisms that ensure system reliability in production environments. Enable graceful degradation when agents fail, provide circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures, and establish recovery strategies that maintain system availability. Create a robust foundation for production monitoring and automated failure recovery.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

* [ ] Health check endpoints provide detailed system status including agent availability, resource usage, and performance metrics
* [ ] Circuit breaker pattern implementation prevents cascading failures when agents are unresponsive or failing
* [ ] Graceful degradation mechanisms provide fallback responses when agents are unavailable
* [ ] Recovery strategies automatically restore normal operations when failed components recover
* [ ] Health monitoring dashboard displays real-time system status and failure patterns
* [ ] Configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts for different agent types and operations
* [ ] Integration with existing performance monitoring system (PERF-001) for comprehensive system visibility
* [ ] Automated alerting and notification system for critical failures and recovery events
* [ ] Load balancing and failover capabilities for high-availability agent operations

## **3. Technical Plan**

* **Approach:** Build production-grade reliability layer that wraps existing agent system with comprehensive health monitoring, circuit breaker patterns, and intelligent fallback mechanisms. Implement health check endpoints for external monitoring systems, create graceful degradation strategies for agent failures, and establish automated recovery processes. Design for enterprise-grade reliability with configurable failure thresholds and recovery strategies.

## **6. Open Questions & Notes**

**Health Check Implementation:**
- **Question:** What specific health metrics should be exposed for agent system monitoring (memory, CPU, response time, error rate)?
- **Question:** How frequently should health checks run without impacting system performance?
- **Question:** Should health checks include dependency verification (file system, network, external services)?

**Circuit Breaker Configuration:**
- **Question:** What failure thresholds and timeout values are appropriate for different agent types (lightweight vs. compute-intensive)?
- **Question:** Should circuit breaker states be shared across agent instances or maintained independently?
- **Question:** How to balance between preventing cascading failures and maintaining system availability?

**Graceful Degradation Strategies:**
- **Question:** What level of functionality should be maintained when agents are unavailable (cached responses, simplified outputs, error messages)?
- **Question:** How to prioritize agent recovery when multiple agents are in degraded state?
- **Question:** Should fallback mechanisms include alternative agent selection or simplified processing paths?

**Recovery and Monitoring:**
- **Question:** What metrics should trigger automatic recovery attempts vs. manual intervention?
- **Question:** How to provide actionable alerts without creating alert fatigue for operations teams?
- **Question:** What level of historical failure data should be retained for pattern analysis?

**Integration Scope:**
- **Question:** Should this system integrate with external monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, PagerDuty) or remain self-contained?
- **Question:** How to handle reliability monitoring in distributed deployments or multi-instance scenarios?
- **Question:** What level of configuration flexibility should be provided for different deployment environments?

**Performance Impact:**
- **Question:** How to minimize the overhead of reliability monitoring on system performance?
- **Question:** What caching strategies are needed for health status data to avoid repeated computation?
- **Question:** How to balance reliability monitoring thoroughness with system resource usage?

**Implementation Notes:**
- Implement comprehensive circuit breaker pattern with configurable failure thresholds and recovery strategies
- Design health endpoints following industry standards (RFC draft-inadarei-api-health-check)
- Build fallback mechanisms that provide meaningful responses even when agents are unavailable
- Create monitoring dashboard with real-time system visibility and failure pattern analysis
- Integrate with existing performance monitoring system for unified operational view
- Plan for enterprise deployment scenarios with external monitoring system integration
- Implement automated recovery strategies that can restore system functionality without manual intervention
- Design for high availability with load balancing and failover capabilities
- Create comprehensive alerting system with intelligent notification filtering
- Plan for operational runbooks and troubleshooting guides for production deployment

**Production Deployment Considerations:**
- Health check endpoints must be lightweight and non-intrusive to system performance
- Circuit breaker thresholds need environment-specific tuning for optimal reliability
- Fallback mechanisms should maintain security boundaries and data integrity
- Recovery strategies must be tested under realistic load and failure scenarios
- Monitoring dashboard requires role-based access control for production environments
