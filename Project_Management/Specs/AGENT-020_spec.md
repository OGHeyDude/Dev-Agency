# AGENT-020: Sprint Execution Strategy Recipe & Slash Command

## Overview
Create an automated sprint execution recipe that takes the output from `/sprint-plan` and creates an optimal implementation strategy. This recipe orchestrates agent assignments, manages parallel execution (up to 5 agents), respects dependencies, applies combination recipes, and ensures all tickets reach DONE status including memory sync and commits.

## User Story
**As a** development team lead  
**I want** an automated execution strategy for my planned sprint  
**So that** implementation proceeds efficiently with optimal agent utilization and all tickets reach DONE

## Problem & Goal

### Problem
After sprint planning (`/sprint-plan`), teams need to determine HOW to execute the implementation efficiently. This includes:
- Which agents to assign to each ticket
- How to parallelize work while respecting dependencies
- When to apply specific combination recipes
- How to ensure consistent quality gates
- Managing the workflow through to DONE status

### Goal
Automate the creation of an execution strategy that:
- Maximizes parallel agent utilization (up to 5)
- Respects all dependencies and blockers
- Applies appropriate recipes for each ticket type
- Ensures consistent quality and completion
- Includes memory sync and commit workflows

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Sprint Loading**
   - Read output from `/sprint-plan`
   - Load all ticket specs and dependencies
   - Identify current ticket statuses

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Create execution order respecting dependencies
   - Identify parallelization opportunities
   - Calculate critical path

3. **Agent Assignment**
   - Map appropriate agents to each ticket
   - Assign recipes based on ticket type
   - Balance agent workload

4. **Parallel Execution Management**
   - Schedule up to 5 agents simultaneously
   - Dynamic reallocation based on completion
   - Handle blocked tickets gracefully

5. **Quality Gates**
   - Enforce testing for each ticket
   - Security review where needed
   - Documentation updates
   - Performance validation

6. **Memory Sync Integration**
   - Sync completed work to knowledge graph
   - Update entities and relationships
   - Track implementation patterns

7. **Commit Workflow**
   - Generate conventional commits
   - Update ticket statuses
   - Maintain clean history

8. **Definition of DONE**
   - Comprehensive checklist per ticket
   - Automated verification
   - Status tracking

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Efficient agent utilization (>80% capacity)
- Flexibility: Support 1-8 parallel agents
- Reliability: Handle failures gracefully
- Visibility: Clear progress reporting

### Execution Algorithm
```javascript
class SprintExecutor {
    constructor(maxAgents = 5) {
        this.maxAgents = maxAgents;
        this.executionQueue = new PriorityQueue();
        this.runningTasks = new Map();
        this.completedTasks = new Set();
    }
    
    async execute(sprintPlan) {
        // Phase 1: Load and analyze
        const tickets = this.loadTickets(sprintPlan);
        const dependencies = this.analyzeDependencies(tickets);
        
        // Phase 2: Create execution plan
        const executionPlan = this.createExecutionPlan(tickets, dependencies);
        
        // Phase 3: Execute with parallelization
        while (!this.isComplete()) {
            // Start new tasks up to max agents
            while (this.canStartNewTask()) {
                const nextTask = this.getNextExecutableTask();
                if (nextTask) {
                    this.startTask(nextTask);
                }
            }
            
            // Monitor and complete tasks
            await this.monitorTasks();
            
            // Update progress
            this.reportProgress();
        }
        
        // Phase 4: Final sync and commit
        await this.syncToMemory();
        await this.commitChanges();
    }
}
```

### Recipe Selection Matrix
```javascript
const recipeMatrix = {
    'bug': 'bug_fix_recipe',
    'security': 'security_audit_recipe',
    'feature': 'full_stack_feature_recipe',
    'api': 'api_feature_recipe',
    'performance': 'performance_optimization_recipe',
    'infrastructure': 'database_migration_recipe',
    'documentation': 'documentation_standardization_recipe'
};
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Created
1. `/recipes/sprint_execution_recipe.md` - Complete 8-phase execution recipe
2. `/Project_Management/Specs/AGENT-020_spec.md` - This specification

### Files Modified
1. `/prompts/slash_commands.md` - Add `/sprint-execute` command
2. `/recipes/README.md` - Add sprint execution recipe
3. `/Project_Management/PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Add AGENT-020 ticket

### Key Differentiators
- **Execution focus** vs planning focus of `/sprint-plan`
- **Implementation strategy** vs ticket selection
- **Agent orchestration** for actual development work
- **Progress through DONE** including all quality gates
- **Memory sync** and commit integration

## Testing Plan

### Test Cases
1. **Standard Execution**
   - 5 agents parallel
   - Mixed ticket types
   - Complex dependencies

2. **Resource Constrained**
   - 2-3 agents only
   - Sequential execution
   - Longer timeline

3. **High Performance**
   - 8 agents parallel
   - Aggressive timeline
   - Maximum throughput

4. **Failure Recovery**
   - Agent failures
   - Blocked tickets
   - Retry mechanisms

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ All tickets reach DONE status
- ✅ Dependencies always respected
- ✅ Agent utilization > 80%
- ✅ Quality gates enforced
- ✅ Memory properly synced
- ✅ Clean commit history

## Success Metrics
- 40% faster sprint completion
- 95% first-time quality (no rework)
- 100% dependency compliance
- 80%+ agent utilization
- Zero dropped tickets

## Risk Analysis

### Risks
1. **Agent Conflicts**: Multiple agents modifying same files
   - **Mitigation**: File locking and coordination

2. **Dependency Cascades**: One delay affects many tickets
   - **Mitigation**: Dynamic rescheduling

3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Too many parallel agents
   - **Mitigation**: Configurable limits and monitoring

## Command Usage

### Basic Command
```bash
/sprint-execute
# or alias
/se
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
/sprint-execute --max-agents 3      # Limit parallelization
/sprint-execute --tickets AGENT-010 # Specific tickets only
/sprint-execute --dry-run          # Preview strategy
/sprint-execute --continue         # Resume execution
/sprint-execute --recipe-override  # Custom recipes
```

### Complete Sprint Flow
```bash
# Plan sprint (WHAT to build)
/sprint-plan --points 35

# Review and approve plan
[Manual review step]

# Execute sprint (HOW to build)
/sprint-execute --max-agents 5

# Monitor progress
/sprint-execute --status

# Complete sprint
/sprint-execute --finalize
```

## Relationship to Sprint Planning

### `/sprint-plan` (AGENT-019) - Planning Phase
- **Focus:** WHAT goes into the sprint
- **Output:** Selected tickets, specs, documentation needs
- **Agents:** Used for planning tasks only
- **Stage:** Before sprint starts

### `/sprint-execute` (AGENT-020) - Execution Phase
- **Focus:** HOW to implement the sprint
- **Output:** Implementation strategy, agent assignments
- **Agents:** Used for actual development work
- **Stage:** During sprint execution
