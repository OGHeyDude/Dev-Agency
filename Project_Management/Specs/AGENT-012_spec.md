# **Spec: TDD Workflow with Agents**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-012`  
**Status:** `BACKLOG`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-10  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Link to Project Plan:** [PROJECT_PLAN.md](../PROJECT_PLAN.md)

## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** Test-driven development (TDD) is a proven methodology for producing high-quality, well-tested code, but it requires discipline, experience, and significant time investment. Many developers struggle with writing effective tests first, designing minimal implementations, and following the red-green-refactor cycle consistently. Manual TDD processes are often abandoned under time pressure or complexity.

**Goal:** Create an automated TDD workflow using Dev-Agency agents that guides developers through the red-green-refactor cycle, automatically generates appropriate tests, implements minimal passing code, and suggests refactoring improvements, making TDD accessible and efficient for developers of all skill levels.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Automated red-green-refactor cycle orchestration with agent coordination
- [ ] Test generation agent that creates comprehensive, failing tests from requirements
- [ ] Implementation agent that writes minimal code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactoring agent that improves code quality while maintaining test passes
- [ ] Test quality validation and improvement suggestions
- [ ] Integration with existing testing frameworks (Jest, PyTest, Go test, etc.)
- [ ] Progress tracking and TDD metrics collection
- [ ] Customizable TDD workflow patterns for different project types
- [ ] Documentation generation for TDD process and decisions
- [ ] Integration with existing Dev-Agency agent system and recipes

## **3. Technical Plan**

**Approach:** Build a comprehensive TDD workflow recipe that orchestrates multiple specialized agents through the red-green-refactor cycle, with intelligent test generation, minimal implementation, and quality-focused refactoring. Implement as both a recipe and a set of workflow commands that integrate with existing Dev-Agency infrastructure.

2. **TDD Cycle Phases**

   **Phase 1: RED (Write Failing Test)**
   - Analyze requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Generate comprehensive test scenarios
   - Create failing tests with proper assertions
   - Validate test quality and coverage scope

   **Phase 2: GREEN (Minimal Implementation)**  
   - Write minimal code to make tests pass
   - Focus on functionality, not optimization
   - Ensure all tests pass with minimal complexity
   - Avoid over-engineering or premature optimization

   **Phase 3: REFACTOR (Improve Code Quality)**
   - Identify code quality improvement opportunities
   - Apply refactoring patterns while maintaining tests
   - Optimize for readability, maintainability, and performance
   - Update documentation and ensure test coverage

### **Agent Specialization**

**1. Test Generator Agent**
- Analyzes requirements and creates comprehensive test scenarios
- Generates failing tests following testing best practices
- Ensures proper test isolation, mocking, and assertions
- Validates test quality and suggests improvements

**2. Minimal Implementer Agent**
- Writes simplest possible code to make tests pass
- Avoids over-engineering and premature optimization
- Focuses on core functionality and basic error handling
- Ensures all tests pass with minimal code complexity

**3. Refactoring Guide Agent**
- Identifies code quality and design improvement opportunities
- Suggests refactoring patterns and architectural improvements
- Ensures refactoring maintains test passes and functionality
- Optimizes for maintainability, performance, and best practices

**4. TDD Coordinator Agent**
- Orchestrates the complete red-green-refactor cycle
- Manages workflow state and progress tracking
- Coordinates between specialized agents
- Provides guidance and next-step recommendations

### **Workflow Commands**

```bash
# Start TDD workflow
/tdd-start [feature-name] [--framework=jest|pytest|go]
/tdd-requirements [description or file]

# TDD cycle phases
/tdd-red          # Generate and run failing tests
/tdd-green        # Implement minimal passing code  
/tdd-refactor     # Improve code quality
/tdd-cycle        # Complete red-green-refactor cycle

# Workflow management
/tdd-status       # Show current phase and progress
/tdd-metrics      # Display TDD metrics and cycle times
/tdd-reset        # Reset workflow state
