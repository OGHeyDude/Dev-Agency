# **Spec: Microservices Development Recipe**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-015`  
**Status:** `TODO`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-09  
**Story Points:** 2  

---

## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** Microservices development lacks standardized patterns for service boundaries, communication, data consistency, and deployment, leading to distributed system complexity and maintenance challenges.

**Goal:** Create a microservices recipe that uses the integration agent to establish proper service boundaries, implement robust communication patterns, and ensure system reliability.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Service boundary definition guidelines
- [ ] Integration agent leads service design
- [ ] Communication pattern templates (REST, gRPC, events)
- [ ] Data consistency strategies documented
- [ ] Service discovery and registry patterns
- [ ] Monitoring and observability setup
- [ ] Deployment orchestration covered
- [ ] Failure handling and circuit breakers

## **3. Technical Plan**

### **Recipe Structure**

**Phase 1: Service Design**
- `/agent:architect` - Domain boundaries
- `/agent:integration` - Service contracts
- Data ownership mapping

**Phase 2: Implementation (Parallel)**
- `/agent:coder` - Service implementation
- `/agent:integration` - API gateway setup
- `/agent:tester` - Contract testing

**Phase 3: Communication Setup**
- Service mesh configuration
- Event bus implementation
- API versioning strategy

**Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring**
- Container orchestration
- Distributed tracing
- Health checks and metrics

### **Key Patterns**

- **Communication**: REST, gRPC, Message Queue
- **Data**: CQRS, Event Sourcing, Saga
- **Resilience**: Circuit Breaker, Retry, Timeout
- **Discovery**: Service Registry, DNS, Mesh
