# STAD-007 Specification: Create Research Agent for Stage 1

**Ticket ID:** STAD-007  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Epic:** Agent Development  
**Sprint:** 8  
**Created:** 08-14-2025  

---

## Description

Create a new Research Agent specifically designed for Stage 1 (Research) of our 7-stage development process. This agent will be an expert at codebase exploration, pattern identification, and existing solution discovery. It must follow anti-clutter principles by always searching for existing work before suggesting new implementations.

## Current State

Currently:
- No dedicated Research Agent exists
- Research is done ad-hoc by developers or Main Claude
- No standardized research methodology
- Duplicate work created due to insufficient research
- No consistent research output format
- Missing pattern identification

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Research Agent created with Stage 1 focus
- [ ] Agent can search codebases effectively
- [ ] Agent identifies patterns and anti-patterns
- [ ] Agent finds existing implementations
- [ ] Agent produces standardized research findings
- [ ] Agent includes micro-reflections
- [ ] Agent follows anti-clutter principles
- [ ] Agent knows output location (`/Project_Management/Specs/[TICKET]/research_findings.md`)
- [ ] Agent can identify reusable components
- [ ] Agent provides clear recommendations

## Agent Assignment

**Recommended Agent:** Coder Agent (with Main Claude orchestration)  
**Reason:** Creating new agent file and prompt engineering

## Agent Design

### Core Capabilities
```markdown
## Research Agent Capabilities

1. **Codebase Search**
   - Use Grep for pattern matching
   - Use Glob for file discovery
   - Search by functionality
   - Search by naming patterns

2. **Pattern Identification**
   - Identify common patterns
   - Spot anti-patterns
   - Find architectural patterns
   - Recognize coding conventions

3. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Find similar implementations
   - Identify reusable components
   - Spot redundant code
   - Suggest consolidation

4. **Solution Discovery**
   - Find existing solutions
   - Identify partial solutions
   - Locate related work
   - Find inspiration code

5. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Suggest approach options
   - Recommend reuse opportunities
   - Propose patterns to follow
   - Warn about anti-patterns
```

### Research Methodology
```markdown
## Research Process

1. **Initial Search Phase**
   - Search for exact matches
   - Search for similar names
   - Search for related concepts
   - Search imports/dependencies

2. **Pattern Analysis Phase**
   - Identify coding patterns
   - Find architectural patterns
   - Spot common structures
   - Note conventions used

3. **Duplicate Check Phase**
   - Search for similar logic
   - Find comparable features
   - Identify shared utilities
   - Check for redundancy

4. **Solution Mapping Phase**
   - Map existing solutions
   - Identify gaps
   - Find integration points
   - Note dependencies

5. **Recommendation Phase**
   - Compile findings
   - Suggest approaches
   - Recommend reuse
   - Propose patterns
```
