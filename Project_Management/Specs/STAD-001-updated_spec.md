# STAD-001 Specification: Align Architect Agent with Stage 1 (Sprint Preparation) (STAD-Aligned)

**Ticket ID:** STAD-001  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Epic:** Agent STAD Alignment  
**Sprint:** 8-Test  
**Created:** 08-16-2025  
**STAD Stage Focus:** Stage 1 (Sprint Preparation)

---

## Description

Update the Architect Agent to focus specifically on STAD Stage 1 (Sprint Preparation). The agent should excel at creating comprehensive specifications that enable zero-intervention execution in Stage 2. This includes complete technical plans, dependency mapping, and all design decisions upfront.

## Current State

The Architect Agent currently:
- Has broad responsibilities across multiple stages
- Lacks specific STAD Stage 1 focus
- Doesn't emphasize comprehensive upfront planning
- Missing standardized spec templates
- No clear handoff protocols to Stage 2 agents

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Architect Agent prompt updated for STAD Stage 1 focus
- [ ] Agent understands "plan everything upfront" principle
- [ ] Agent uses comprehensive spec template from STAD-005
- [ ] Agent creates specs enabling zero-intervention Stage 2
- [ ] Agent generates dependency graphs (DAGs)
- [ ] Agent identifies parallelization opportunities
- [ ] Agent knows spec location: `/Project_Management/Specs/`
- [ ] Agent creates proper handoffs for Stage 2 agents
- [ ] Updated agent passes STAD compliance check

## Technical Specification

### Agent Update Requirements

1. **Stage 1 Primary Responsibilities**
   - Translate epics into detailed technical specifications
   - Document ALL design decisions upfront
   - Create dependency graphs showing execution order
   - Identify parallel execution opportunities
   - Define acceptance criteria completely
   - Plan for edge cases and error handling

2. **Key Principle to Embed**
   ```
   "The better you plan, the better the outcome."
   Stage 1 planning must be so complete that Stage 2 
   can execute without any design decisions.
   ```

3. **Required Spec Sections**
   - Technical architecture
   - Complete implementation steps
   - All technology choices with rationale
   - Dependency graph (Mermaid format)
   - Parallelization matrix
   - Edge case handling
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Test scenarios

4. **Example DAG Generation**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       STAD-005[Templates] --> STAD-001[Architect]
       STAD-005 --> STAD-002[Coder]
       STAD-006[Folders] --> STAD-001
       STAD-006 --> STAD-002
       STAD-001 --> STAD-007[Research]
       STAD-002 --> STAD-008[Reflection]
   ```

5. **Handoff Protocol**
   - Create handoff document for Stage 2 agents
   - Include all decisions made
   - Specify execution sequence
   - Note parallel opportunities
   - Save to `/Sprint_Execution/Sprint_[N]/agent_handoffs/`

### Updates to architect.md

```markdown
## STAD Stage
**Stage 1 (Sprint Preparation)** - Primary responsibility

## Core Principle
"Plan everything upfront, execute without intervention"

## Stage 1 Deliverables
1. Comprehensive technical specifications
2. Complete dependency graphs
3. All design decisions documented
4. Parallelization opportunities identified
5. Handoff documents for Stage 2 agents

## Quality Criteria
- Specs enable zero-intervention execution
- No design decisions needed in Stage 2
- All edge cases addressed
- Dependencies clearly mapped
```

## Dependencies

### Depends On:
- STAD-005 (Templates must exist)
- STAD-006 (Must know folder structure)

### Blocks:
- Stage 2 execution (Agents need complete specs)

## Success Metrics

- Architect produces 100% complete specs
- Stage 2 executes without design questions
- Dependency graphs accurately represent flow
- Parallel opportunities properly identified
- Handoffs contain all needed information

## Notes

- This is critical for STAD success
- Focus on comprehensive planning
- Quality of Stage 1 determines Stage 2 success
- Agent must understand zero-intervention principle
