# **Spec: Feedback Loops and Refinement Process**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-005`  
**Status:** `TODO`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-09  
**Story Points:** 3  

---

## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** The Dev-Agency system lacks systematic feedback collection and continuous improvement processes. Agent effectiveness, recipe quality, and tool usage patterns are not measured or optimized over time.

**Goal:** Establish comprehensive feedback loops and refinement processes that capture performance metrics, user feedback, and system effectiveness to drive data-driven improvements across all Dev-Agency components.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Agent performance feedback collection system
- [ ] Recipe effectiveness tracking and analytics
- [ ] Tool usage pattern analysis
- [ ] Continuous improvement workflow established
- [ ] Metrics dashboard integration (external tool)
- [ ] Regular review cycles and cadence defined
- [ ] Improvement prioritization framework
- [ ] Feedback integration with development workflow

## **3. Technical Plan**

**Approach:** Create a lightweight, process-focused feedback system that integrates with existing workflows and leverages external observability tools for metrics collection.

### **Feedback Collection Points**

1. **Agent Performance Metrics**
   - Success rate tracking per agent type
   - Context optimization effectiveness (from AGENT-010)
   - Response quality assessment
   - Token usage efficiency

2. **Recipe Effectiveness**
   - Recipe execution success rates
   - Time savings validation
   - Quality outcome measurement
   - User satisfaction surveys

3. **Tool Usage Analytics**
   - CLI adoption rates (from AGENT-013)
   - Agent selection accuracy (from AGENT-011)
   - Feature utilization patterns
   - Performance bottleneck identification

### **Improvement Processes**

**Review Cycles:**
- Weekly: Performance metric review
- Monthly: Recipe effectiveness analysis
- Quarterly: System architecture evaluation

**Improvement Framework:**
1. Data collection and analysis
2. Issue identification and prioritization
3. Solution design and implementation
4. Impact measurement and validation

### **Integration Strategy**

- **Existing Systems**: Leverage AGENT-013 CLI for data collection
- **External Tools**: Use external Observability Tool for metrics
- **Workflows**: Integrate feedback into existing `/done` and `/reflect` commands
