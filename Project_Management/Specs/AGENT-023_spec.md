## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** Debugging complex multi-agent workflows in the Dev-Agency system is challenging without proper visualization tools. Developers and system administrators struggle to understand agent execution flows, identify bottlenecks in decision-making processes, trace token usage patterns, and debug issues that span multiple agent interactions. Current logging and metrics provide data points but lack the visual context and interactive exploration needed for effective troubleshooting and system understanding.

**Goal:** Build an advanced debugging and trace visualization tool that provides interactive visual representations of agent execution flows, decision trees, token usage patterns, and performance bottlenecks. Enable developers to set breakpoints, step through agent interactions, and explore system behavior with rich visual feedback for faster troubleshooting and better system comprehension.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] **Visual Execution Flow Diagrams:** Generate interactive flowcharts showing agent execution sequences, decision points, and data flow between agents with clickable nodes for detailed inspection
- [ ] **Token Usage Visualization:** Display real-time and historical token consumption patterns with heat maps, trend analysis, and cost breakdowns per agent and workflow
- [ ] **Interactive Decision Tree Explorer:** Provide expandable decision trees showing agent reasoning paths, alternative options considered, and confidence scores for each decision
- [ ] **Breakpoint and Step-through Debugging:** Enable setting breakpoints in agent workflows with step-by-step execution control and state inspection capabilities
- [ ] **Performance Bottleneck Detection:** Automatically identify and highlight slow operations, resource-intensive agents, and execution bottlenecks with actionable optimization suggestions
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Workflow Tracing:** Track and visualize complex workflows involving multiple agents with timeline views and dependency mapping

## **3. Technical Plan**

**Approach:** Build a web-based debugging interface using React/TypeScript with D3.js for interactive visualizations. Implement a trace collection system that hooks into the existing agent execution framework to capture detailed execution data. Create a real-time WebSocket connection for live debugging and historical data analysis capabilities.

**Affected Components:**
- `tools/agent-cli/src/core/ExecutionEngine.ts` (add trace hooks)
- `tools/agent-cli/src/utils/Logger.ts` (enhance with trace data collection)
- New component: `tools/debug-visualizer/` (main debugging interface)
- New component: `tools/debug-visualizer/trace-collector/` (execution data capture)
- `feedback/metrics_dashboard.md` (integration with existing metrics)

**New Dependencies:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- D3.js for data visualization
- WebSocket library (ws or socket.io)
- Cytoscape.js for network/flow diagrams
- Chart.js for performance charts
- Monaco Editor for code inspection

**Database Changes:**
- New trace data storage schema in existing metrics collection
- Execution timeline table with agent interactions
- Decision path storage with reasoning data
- Performance snapshot tables

## **4. Feature Boundaries & Impact**

### **Owned Resources** (Safe to Modify)
- [ ] `tools/debug-visualizer/*` (all debugging tool files)
- [ ] `tools/debug-visualizer/src/components/FlowDiagram.tsx`
- [ ] `tools/debug-visualizer/src/components/TokenUsageChart.tsx`
- [ ] `tools/debug-visualizer/src/components/DecisionTree.tsx`
- [ ] `tools/debug-visualizer/src/components/DebugConsole.tsx`
- [ ] `tools/debug-visualizer/styles/debug-visualizer.module.css`
- [ ] `tools/debug-visualizer/tests/*`

### **Shared Dependencies** (Constraints Apply)
- [ ] `tools/agent-cli/src/utils/Logger.ts` (EXTEND-ONLY - add trace methods, don't modify existing)
- [ ] `tools/agent-cli/src/core/ExecutionEngine.ts` (EXTEND-ONLY - add hooks, preserve existing functionality)
- [ ] `feedback/metrics_dashboard.md` (READ-ONLY - reference existing metrics structure)
- [ ] `tools/agent-cli/src/utils/PerformanceCache.ts` (READ-ONLY - access cached data)

### **Impact Radius**
- **Direct impacts:** Agent CLI tool (minimal hooks for trace collection), metrics collection system
- **Indirect impacts:** Performance dashboard (shared data sources), existing logging systems
- **Required regression tests:** Agent execution tests, performance benchmarks, CLI tool integration tests

### **Safe Modification Strategy**
- [ ] Use CSS modules for all styling (no global styles)
- [ ] Create separate trace collection hooks without modifying core execution logic
- [ ] Use feature flags for debugging mode activation
- [ ] Create debugging-specific utilities instead of modifying shared logging
- [ ] Use design tokens: var(--color-debug-primary), var(--color-trace-success)

### **Technical Enforcement**
- **Pre-commit hooks:** `boundary-check, debug-isolation-validation`
- **CI/CD checks:** `trace-collection-tests, visualization-rendering-tests`
- **File permissions:** Run `set-debug-boundaries.sh` before starting

## **5. Research & References**

**Existing System Analysis:**
- `tools/agent-cli/src/core/ExecutionEngine.ts` - Current execution flow and agent orchestration patterns
- `tools/agent-cli/src/utils/Logger.ts` - Existing logging infrastructure that can be extended for trace collection
- `feedback/metrics_dashboard.md` - Current metrics collection and display patterns
- `Project_Management/Specs/AGENT-006_spec.md` - Performance dashboard integration opportunities
- `Project_Management/Specs/AGENT-014_spec.md` - Benchmarking suite data sources for performance analysis

**Similar Tools & Inspiration:**

- Monaco Editor integration for code inspection interfaces

## **6. Open Questions & Notes**

**Questions:**
- **Data Retention:** How long should trace data be stored? Should we implement automatic cleanup for debugging sessions?
- **Performance Impact:** What's the acceptable overhead for trace collection during normal agent operations?
- **Security Considerations:** Should debugging mode be restricted to specific environments or user roles?
- **Integration Scope:** Should this tool integrate with external APM solutions (Datadog, New Relic) or remain standalone?

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Trace Collection Strategy:** Implement non-blocking async trace collection to minimize impact on agent performance
- **Visualization Performance:** Consider virtualization for large execution flows (1000+ agent interactions)
- **Real-time Updates:** Use WebSocket heartbeat to maintain connection during long debugging sessions  
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure debugging interface works on different screen sizes and orientations
- **Accessibility:** Implement keyboard navigation and screen reader support for debugging interface

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Integration with VS Code extension for in-editor debugging
- AI-powered anomaly detection in execution patterns
- Collaborative debugging sessions for team troubleshooting
- Export capabilities for execution traces and performance reports
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines for automated debugging reports
