# **Spec: Performance Benchmarking Suite**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-014`  
**Status:** `BACKLOG`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-10  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Link to Project Plan:** [PROJECT_PLAN.md](../PROJECT_PLAN.md)

## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** Dev-Agency system lacks comprehensive performance benchmarking and load testing capabilities. Without systematic performance measurement, it's difficult to identify bottlenecks, validate optimizations, compare performance across versions, or ensure system reliability under various load conditions. Performance degradation often goes undetected until it impacts user experience.

**Goal:** Build a comprehensive performance benchmarking suite that measures system performance across multiple dimensions, identifies bottlenecks, validates optimizations, supports load testing scenarios, and provides actionable insights for system improvement and capacity planning.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Agent execution performance benchmarks (response time, success rate, resource usage)
- [ ] System-wide load testing with configurable scenarios and user patterns
- [ ] Memory usage profiling and leak detection across all components
- [ ] Token usage efficiency benchmarks and optimization validation
- [ ] Concurrent agent execution performance and scaling validation
- [ ] Context optimization effectiveness measurement (integration with AGENT-010)
- [ ] Recipe performance benchmarks and comparison analysis
- [ ] Historical performance tracking and regression detection
- [ ] Automated performance testing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Comprehensive performance reporting and visualization

## **3. Technical Plan**

**Approach:** Build a multi-faceted benchmarking suite that covers agent performance, system load testing, resource utilization, and optimization effectiveness. Implement automated benchmark execution, historical comparison, and integration with existing performance tracking infrastructure.
