# **Spec: Context Size Optimizer Tool**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-010`  
**Status:** `TODO`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-09  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** 08-10-2025 to 08-24-2025

## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** Agent invocations in the Dev-Agency system often hit token limits when processing large codebases, leading to failed executions, incomplete analysis, and reduced agent effectiveness. Context bloat includes irrelevant code, verbose documentation, and redundant information that degrades performance without adding value.

**Goal:** Build an intelligent context optimization tool that automatically analyzes, prioritizes, and prunes context for agent invocations, achieving 30% reduction in context size while maintaining quality. Enable seamless agent operations on large codebases with real-time optimization and performance tracking.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Context analyzer accurately measures token count for multiple file types
- [ ] Intelligent pruning removes irrelevant content while preserving critical information
- [ ] Context prioritization algorithm ranks content by relevance to agent task
- [ ] Token prediction prevents limit breaches with 95% accuracy
- [ ] Context caching system stores and reuses optimized contexts
- [ ] Real-time optimization integrates seamlessly with existing workflow
- [ ] Performance metrics show 30% average context reduction
- [ ] Configuration system allows customizable optimization strategies
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms handle edge cases gracefully
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples and troubleshooting

## **3. Technical Plan**

**Approach:** Build a modular context optimization system with pluggable strategies, token counting, content analysis, and caching mechanisms. Implement as a tool that intercepts agent invocations to optimize context before execution.

### **Core Components**

1. **Context Analyzer**
   - Token counter with model-specific accuracy
   - Content type detector (code vs docs vs config)
   - Complexity scorer for code segments
   - Dependency mapper for import analysis

2. **Optimization Engine**
   - Pruning strategies (comment removal, dead code detection)
   - Prioritization algorithms (relevance scoring)
   - Content summarization for verbose documentation
   - Smart truncation with preserved semantics

3. **Cache Manager**
   - LRU cache for optimized contexts
   - Context fingerprinting for reuse detection
   - Cache invalidation on file changes
   - Compressed storage for large contexts

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Agent invocation interceptor
   - Transparent optimization middleware
   - Fallback handling for failures
   - Performance metric collection

### **Optimization Strategies**

**Code Optimization:**
- Remove non-critical comments and docstrings
- Eliminate dead code and unused imports
- Compress whitespace and formatting
- Extract signatures while preserving logic

**Documentation Optimization:**
- Summarize verbose sections
- Remove redundant examples
- Preserve API references and key concepts
- Smart truncation with context preservation

**Content Prioritization:**
- Score by relevance to agent task
- Weight by file importance in codebase
- Prioritize recent changes
- Consider inter-file dependencies

### **Performance Targets**

- **Context Reduction:** 30% average size reduction
- **Token Accuracy:** 95% prediction accuracy
- **Response Time:** <500ms optimization overhead
- **Cache Hit Rate:** 70% for repeated tasks
- **Quality Preservation:** No degradation in agent output

## **4. Implementation Phases**

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
- Basic token counting and file analysis
- Simple pruning strategies
- Integration with agent pipeline

**Phase 2: Advanced Optimization**
- Intelligent prioritization algorithms
- Context caching with performance tuning
- Configuration system

**Phase 3: Integration & Testing**
- Seamless workflow integration
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Documentation and user guides

## **5. Success Metrics**

- 30% reduction in average context size
- Zero token limit errors in production
- <500ms processing overhead
- 90% user satisfaction with optimization quality
- 70% cache hit rate for common operations

## **6. Dependencies**

- Integration with existing agent invocation system
- Compatibility with all agent types
- Configuration management system
- Performance monitoring infrastructure
