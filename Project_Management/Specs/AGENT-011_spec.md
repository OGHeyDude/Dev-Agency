# **Spec: Agent Selection Assistant**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-011`  
**Status:** `TODO`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-09  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Sprint:** 08-10-2025 to 08-24-2025

## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** Developers often struggle to select the right agent or combination of agents for their tasks, leading to suboptimal results and inefficient workflows. Current selection is manual and requires deep knowledge of each agent's capabilities.

**Goal:** Build an intelligent assistant that analyzes tasks and recommends the most appropriate agents or recipes, providing clear reasoning and improving developer productivity through optimal agent selection.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Task analysis engine that understands development needs
- [ ] Agent capability matching with confidence scoring
- [ ] Recipe suggestions for common task patterns
- [ ] Multi-agent workflow recommendations
- [ ] Interactive selection wizard for complex scenarios
- [ ] Performance history tracking for recommendations
- [ ] Integration with CLI tool (AGENT-013)
- [ ] Clear reasoning for all recommendations
- [ ] Learning from user feedback on suggestions
- [ ] Support for custom task patterns

## **3. Technical Plan**

**Approach:** Build a rule-based recommendation engine with task pattern matching, integrated with the CLI tool for seamless workflow enhancement.

### **Core Features**

1. **Task Analyzer**
   - Natural language processing for task descriptions
   - Keyword extraction and pattern matching
   - Task categorization (feature, bug, refactor, etc.)

2. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Agent capability scoring matrix
   - Recipe pattern matching
   - Multi-agent combination logic
   - Confidence level calculation

3. **Interactive Wizard**
   - Step-by-step task refinement
   - Progressive agent selection
   - Context requirement gathering

4. **Performance Tracking**
   - Success rate monitoring
   - Feedback collection
   - Recommendation improvement

### **Integration Points**

```bash
# CLI Integration
agent select --task "implement user authentication"
> Recommended: architect → coder → tester → security
> Confidence: 92%
> Recipe: full-stack-feature

agent wizard
> What type of task? [feature/bug/refactor/optimization]
> What components? [frontend/backend/database/all]
> Recommended agents: ...
```

### **Recommendation Logic**

```
Task Input → Keyword Analysis → Pattern Matching
    ↓                              ↓
Task Category ← Score Agents → Recipe Check
    ↓                              ↓
Multi-Agent Plan ← Combine → Final Recommendation
```

## **4. Success Metrics**

- Recommendation accuracy: >85%
- User acceptance rate: >70%
- Time to selection: <30 seconds
- Recipe match rate: >60%

## **5. Dependencies**

- Integration with CLI tool (AGENT-013)
- Access to agent definitions
- Recipe system integration
- Performance metrics data
