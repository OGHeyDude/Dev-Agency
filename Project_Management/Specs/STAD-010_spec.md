```

## 4. Stage Gate Validation Process

### Purpose of Stage Gates
- Ensure quality at each transition
- Prevent cascade failures
- Maintain autonomous execution
- Enable rollback if needed

### Stage Gate Checklist

- **Stage 1 â†’ 2**: All specs complete, tickets â‰¤5 points
- **Stage 2 â†’ 3**: All implementations complete, tests pass
- **Stage 3 â†’ 4**: Quality validated, human approved
- **Stage 4 â†’ Next**: Retrospective complete, learnings captured

## 5. Sprint Planning & Execution

### Sprint Planning (Stage 0 â†’ Stage 1)
1. Select epic for sprint
2. Run `/stad:prep [EPIC-ID]`
3. Architect Agent creates comprehensive specs
4. Human reviews and approves for Stage 2

### Sprint Execution (Stage 1 â†’ Stage 2)
1. Run `/stad:execute`
2. Implementation agents work autonomously
3. Zero human intervention required
4. All decisions based on Stage 1 specs

### Sprint Validation (Stage 2 â†’ Stage 3)
1. Run `/stad:validate`
2. Backend QA Agent performs comprehensive testing
3. Human reviews functional requirements
4. Quality gates validate readiness

### Sprint Completion (Stage 3 â†’ Stage 4)
1. Run `/stad:release`
2. Merge and deploy
3. Retrospective Agent analyzes sprint
4. Knowledge graph updated

## 6. Examples & Scenarios

### Example 1: Feature Development Sprint
**Epic:** User Authentication System (21 points)

**Stage 0:** Business defines authentication requirements
**Stage 1:** Architect creates specs for login, registration, security
**Stage 2:** Coder implements, Tester validates, Documenter updates
**Stage 3:** Backend QA validates security, performance, integration
**Stage 4:** Deploy to production, capture security learnings

### Example 2: Bug Bash Sprint
**Epic:** Critical Bug Fixes (13 points)

**Stage 0:** Prioritize critical bugs from backlog
**Stage 1:** Architect analyzes root causes, creates fix specs
**Stage 2:** Debug Agent fixes issues, Tester validates
**Stage 3:** Backend QA ensures no regressions
**Stage 4:** Deploy fixes, analyze prevention strategies

## 7. Troubleshooting STAD Implementation

### Common Issues

1. **Issue:** Stage 1 specs incomplete
   **Solution:** Run `/stad:gate 1` to validate readiness

2. **Issue:** Stage 2 agents request clarification
   **Solution:** Return to Stage 1, improve specifications

3. **Issue:** Stage 3 validation failures
   **Solution:** Return to Stage 2, fix implementations

4. **Issue:** Human intervention needed in Stage 2
   **Solution:** Pause sprint, improve Stage 1 planning

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
/stad:health        # Check sprint health
/stad:gate [N]      # Validate specific stage gate
/stad:handoff       # Review agent communications
/stad:override      # Human intervention (emergency only)
```

## 8. Best Practices by Stage

## 10. FAQ

**Q: Can I skip a stage if it doesn't apply?**
A: No. Each stage has specific quality gates. Mark outputs as N/A with justification if needed.

**Q: What if I need to intervene during Stage 2?**
A: Use `/stad:pause` and `/stad:override`. This indicates Stage 1 planning was insufficient.

**Q: How detailed should Stage 1 specifications be?**
A: Detailed enough that Stage 2 agents need zero clarification. When in doubt, add more detail.

**Q: Can multiple sprints run in parallel?**
A: Yes, but each sprint follows the complete 5-stage lifecycle independently.

**Q: What if Stage 3 validation fails?**
A: Return to Stage 2 for fixes. Never skip validation.
