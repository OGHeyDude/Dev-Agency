# AGENT-019: Sprint Planning Automation Recipe & Slash Command

## Overview
Create an automated sprint planning recipe that handles ticket selection, spec writing, documentation mapping, dependency analysis, and context preparation. This eliminates guesswork during implementation and reduces sprint planning time by 75%.

## User Story
**As a** development team lead  
**I want** automated sprint planning that prepares everything needed  
**So that** implementation can proceed without delays or missing context

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Sprint Analysis**
   - Review previous sprint velocity and completion rates
   - Identify carry-over work from current sprint
   - Calculate team capacity based on history

2. **Intelligent Ticket Selection**
   - Target 30-35 story points (configurable)
   - Prioritize: Critical issues → Dependencies → Business value
   - Balance ticket sizes (mix of small, medium, large)
   - Maximum 8 tickets for focus

3. **Automated Spec Writing**
   - Generate specs for all tickets without them
   - Include: Problem, Goal, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Plan
   - Map documentation requirements per ticket
   - Identify agent context needs

4. **Documentation Planning**
   - For each ticket identify:
     - Documents to read for context
     - Documents requiring updates
     - New documents to create
   - Generate documentation roadmap

5. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Create dependency graph between tickets
   - Identify blockers and prerequisites
   - Suggest optimal work sequence
   - Flag parallelization opportunities

6. **Context Preparation**
   - Gather relevant files for each ticket
   - Prepare agent-specific context packages
   - Include code examples and patterns
   - Eliminate implementation guesswork

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Complete planning in < 2 hours (vs 4-6 manual)
- Accuracy: 100% tickets have specs before sprint start
- Flexibility: Support various sprint configurations
- Usability: Clear, actionable output

## Technical Design

### Architecture
```
Main Claude (Orchestrator)
    ├── Analysis & Preparation
    ├── /agent:architect (Ticket Selection)
    ├── /agent:documenter (Spec Writing - Parallel)
    ├── /agent:documenter (Documentation Mapping)
    ├── /agent:architect (Dependency Analysis)
    └── Plan Generation & Packaging
```

### Sprint Selection Algorithm
```javascript
function selectSprintTickets(backlog, targetPoints = 33) {
    // Priority scoring
    const priorityScore = (ticket) => {
        let score = 0;
        if (ticket.type === 'SECURITY') score += 100;
        if (ticket.type === 'BUILD') score += 90;
        if (ticket.status === 'IN_PROGRESS') score += 80;
        if (ticket.blocksOthers) score += 50;
        score += ticket.businessValue * 10;
        score -= ticket.risk * 5;
        return score;
    };
    
    // Size balancing
    const sizeDistribution = {
        small: 2-3,    // 1-2 points
        medium: 3-4,   // 3-5 points
        large: 1-2     // 8-13 points
    };
    
    // Select optimal mix
    return optimizeSelection(backlog, targetPoints, sizeDistribution);
}
```

### Parallel Spec Writing
```javascript
// Parallel execution for efficiency
const specTasks = ticketsWithoutSpecs.map(ticket => ({
    agent: 'documenter',
    context: prepareSpecContext(ticket),
    timeout: 10_minutes
}));

await Promise.all(specTasks);
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Created
1. `/recipes/sprint_planning_recipe.md` - Complete recipe (7 phases)
2. `/prompts/slash_commands.md` - Updated with `/sprint-plan` command
3. `/Project_Management/Specs/AGENT-019_spec.md` - This specification

### Files Modified
1. `/prompts/slash_commands.md` - Added sprint planning command section

### Unique Features (No Overlap with Other Recipes)
- **Sprint-level planning** (not individual ticket work)
- **Batch spec generation** (unique to this recipe)
- **Documentation roadmap** creation
- **Dependency graph** generation
- **Context package** preparation

## Testing Plan

### Test Cases
1. **Standard Sprint Planning**
   - 30-35 points selection
   - Mix of ticket sizes
   - All specs generated

2. **Emergency Sprint**
   - Quick mode with minimal specs
   - Focus on critical issues only
   - 15-20 points

3. **Feature Sprint**
   - Single epic focus
   - Deep documentation planning
   - Extended context preparation

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ Selected tickets total 30-35 points
- ✅ All tickets have complete specs
- ✅ Documentation roadmap created
- ✅ Dependencies correctly mapped
- ✅ Context packages prepared
- ✅ Work sequence optimized

## Success Metrics
- 75% reduction in planning time (6 hours → 1.5 hours)
- 100% spec coverage before sprint start
- Zero "blocked by missing context" issues
- 85%+ sprint completion rate
- Improved velocity predictability

## Risk Analysis

### Risks
1. **Over-automation**: Loss of human judgment
   - **Mitigation**: Review step before finalization

2. **Spec Quality**: Auto-generated specs may lack nuance
   - **Mitigation**: Human review and refinement

3. **Dependency Complexity**: Complex dependencies hard to map
   - **Mitigation**: Manual override option

## Command Usage

### Basic Command
```bash
/sprint-plan
# or alias
/sp
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
/sprint-plan --points 40        # Higher capacity
/sprint-plan --priority security # Focus area
/sprint-plan --continue         # Include WIP
/sprint-plan --quick            # Emergency mode
```

### Integration Flow
```
/sprint-plan → Review Output → Adjust if Needed → Commit Plan → Start Sprint
```

## Differentiation from Other Recipes

This recipe is unique because it:
1. **Operates at sprint level** (not individual tickets)
2. **Generates multiple specs** in parallel
3. **Creates documentation roadmaps**
4. **Analyzes cross-ticket dependencies**
5. **Prepares context packages** for entire sprint

Other recipes focus on:
- Individual feature implementation
- Single ticket workflows
- Specific technical tasks
- Quality checks and audits

No overlap or redundancy with existing recipes.

## Implementation Status

### Completed (08-09-2025)
- ✅ Created comprehensive 7-phase recipe
- ✅ Designed slash command with options
- ✅ Documented all variations
- ✅ Verified no overlap with existing recipes

### Pending
- [ ] Live testing with actual sprint planning
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Team feedback integration

## Notes
- Phases use unique numbering (Phase 1-7) vs other recipes (Step 1-N)
- Emphasizes upfront preparation to eliminate downstream blocks
- Designed for 2-week sprints but adaptable
- Can be customized per team preferences
