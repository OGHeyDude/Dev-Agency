# AGENT-031: Agent Collaboration Orchestrator

## Overview

**Goal:** Create an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple agents working together on complex tasks, optimizing for efficiency through parallel execution and smart context passing.

**Points:** 5  
**Epic:** Advanced Automation  
**Priority:** High

## Problem Statement

Currently, complex tasks requiring multiple agents are executed sequentially with manual coordination. This leads to:
- Inefficient use of agent capabilities
- Redundant context preparation
- Missed parallelization opportunities
- Manual dependency tracking
- Suboptimal agent selection

## Solution Design

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Orchestrator      │
│   Controller        │
└──────┬──────────────┘
       │
       ├── Task Analyzer
       ├── Dependency Graph Builder
       ├── Agent Selector
       ├── Context Optimizer
       └── Execution Engine
           ├── Sequential Executor
           ├── Parallel Executor
           └── Progress Tracker
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Task Analyzer
- Breaks complex tasks into agent-executable subtasks
- Identifies task dependencies and ordering requirements
- Estimates complexity and agent requirements

#### 2. Dependency Graph Builder
- Creates directed acyclic graph (DAG) of task dependencies
- Identifies parallelization opportunities
- Optimizes execution order for efficiency

#### 3. Agent Selector
- Matches subtasks to optimal agents based on capabilities
- Considers agent performance history
- Balances workload across available agents

#### 4. Context Optimizer
- Minimizes context size for each agent invocation
- Shares common context efficiently
- Prunes unnecessary information per agent

#### 5. Execution Engine
- Manages sequential and parallel execution
- Handles failures and retries
- Tracks progress and updates status

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details

**Location:** `/src/orchestration/`

**Key Files:**
- `orchestrator.ts` - Main orchestration controller
- `task-analyzer.ts` - Task decomposition logic
- `dependency-graph.ts` - DAG creation and optimization
- `agent-selector.ts` - Agent matching algorithms
- `context-optimizer.ts` - Context management
- `execution-engine.ts` - Execution coordination

### Agent Integration

**Supported Agent Combinations:**
- architect → coder → tester (sequential)
- coder + documenter (parallel)
- security + performance (parallel analysis)
- Multiple coders on independent components (parallel)

### Configuration

```typescript
interface OrchestrationConfig {
  maxParallelAgents: number;  // Default: 4
  contextSizeLimit: number;   // Token limit per agent
  retryAttempts: number;      // Default: 2
  timeoutPerAgent: number;    // Milliseconds
  optimizationLevel: 'speed' | 'quality' | 'balanced';
}
```
