# STAD-005 Specification: Create Stage-Specific Output Templates (STAD-Aligned)

**Ticket ID:** STAD-005  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Epic:** Templates & Standards  
**Sprint:** 8-Test  
**Created:** 08-16-2025  
**STAD Stage Focus:** Stage 1 (Sprint Preparation)

---

## Description

Create standardized output templates for each of the 5 STAD Protocol stages. These templates will ensure consistency across all agents and developers, facilitate work reports (replacing micro-reflections), and enable effective sprint retrospectives.

## Current State

Currently we have:
- No standardized templates for STAD stage outputs
- Inconsistent documentation across tickets
- No structured way to capture work reports
- Difficulty aggregating insights for retrospectives
- Each agent/developer uses different formats

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Template created for Stage 0 (Strategic Planning) - epic_definition.md
- [ ] Template created for Stage 1 (Sprint Preparation) - comprehensive_spec.md
- [ ] Template created for Stage 2 (Sprint Execution) - implementation_report.md
- [ ] Template created for Stage 3 (Sprint Validation) - validation_report.md
- [ ] Template created for Stage 4 (Release & Retrospective) - retrospective_summary.md
- [ ] All templates include work report sections
- [ ] Templates are clear and actionable
- [ ] Templates saved in `/docs/reference/templates/STAD_Stage_Templates/`
- [ ] Usage guide created for all templates

## Technical Specification

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create STAD Stage Templates Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /docs/reference/templates/STAD_Stage_Templates/
   ```

2. **Stage 0 Template: Epic Definition**
   - Business objectives
   - Technical feasibility
   - Risk assessment
   - Roadmap integration

3. **Stage 1 Template: Comprehensive Spec**
   - Complete technical specification
   - All design decisions documented
   - Dependencies mapped
   - Acceptance criteria defined
   - No implementation details needed during execution

4. **Stage 2 Template: Implementation Report**
   - Work completed by each agent
   - Code/tests/docs created
   - Handoffs between agents
   - Zero design decisions (all from Stage 1)

5. **Stage 3 Template: Validation Report**
   - Quality gates passed/failed
   - Test coverage metrics
   - Security validation results
   - Performance benchmarks

6. **Stage 4 Template: Retrospective Summary**
   - Sprint velocity achieved
   - Lessons learned
   - Process improvements identified
   - Agent performance metrics

### Template Structure Example

```markdown
# [Stage Name] Report - [SPRINT-ID]

## Metadata
- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Stage:** [0-4]
- **Sprint:** [Sprint ID]
- **Status:** [Complete/In Progress]

## Stage Inputs
[What was received from previous stage]

## Stage Outputs
[What this stage produced]

## Work Report
### Accomplishments
- [Key achievement 1]
- [Key achievement 2]

### Challenges
- **Challenge:** [Description]
  - **Resolution:** [How resolved]
  - **Impact:** [Time/scope impact]

### Stage Gate Validation
- [ ] All required outputs complete
- [ ] Quality criteria met
- [ ] Ready for next stage

## Handoff to Next Stage
[What next stage needs to know]
```

## Dependencies

### Depends On:
- None (Foundation ticket)

### Blocks:
- STAD-001 (Architect needs templates for Stage 1)
- STAD-006 (Folder organization uses template locations)

## Success Metrics

- All 5 STAD stage templates created
- Templates used consistently across sprint
- Work reports provide actionable insights
- Templates enable efficient retrospectives
- 90% compliance with template usage

## Notes

- Templates must align with STAD Protocol v5.1
- Focus on stage gates and quality enforcement
- Keep templates practical, not bureaucratic
- Ensure work reports feed into retrospectives
