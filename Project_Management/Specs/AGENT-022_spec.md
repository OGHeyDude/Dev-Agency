# AGENT-022: Self-improving Agent with Learning Capabilities

## Overview

**Goal:** Create agents that learn from successful execution patterns, adapt their prompts based on performance data, and continuously improve their effectiveness over time.

**Points:** 8  
**Epic:** Agent Intelligence  
**Priority:** High

## Problem Statement

Current agents operate with static prompts and don't learn from experience:
- No improvement from successful patterns
- Static prompts regardless of context
- No adaptation to project-specific needs
- Missed optimization opportunities
- Manual prompt refinement required

## Solution Design

  evolutionStrategy: {
    promptMutation: number;  // 0-1 mutation rate
    contextPruning: boolean;
    patternMatching: boolean;
    crossLearning: boolean;  // Learn from other agents
  };
  metrics: {
    successRate: number;

## Agent Enhancement Example

### Before Learning
```yaml
prompt: |
  You are a code review agent.
  Review the provided code for issues.
  Provide feedback on quality.
```

### After Learning (30 days)
```yaml
prompt: |
  You are a code review specialist for TypeScript projects.
  
  Focus areas (learned from 87% success patterns):
  1. Type safety violations (priority: high)
  2. Async/await error handling (priority: high)  
  3. Performance bottlenecks in loops (priority: medium)
  4. Unused imports and dead code (priority: low)
  
  Project-specific patterns detected:
  - Uses React functional components
  - Follows BEM naming convention
  - Prefers composition over inheritance
  
  Provide actionable feedback with code examples.
  Flag critical issues first, then improvements.
```
