**Ticket ID:** STAD-001  
**Story Points:** 3

## Description

Update the Architect Agent to focus specifically on Stage 1 (Sprint Preparation) of the STAD Protocol 5-stage lifecycle. The agent should understand its role as the technical specification expert, creating comprehensive specs, dependency graphs (DAGs), and execution plans that enable zero-intervention execution in Stage 2.

## Background: STAD Protocol Stages

The STAD Protocol defines 5 stages (0-4), NOT 7:
- **Stage 0:** Strategic Planning (Epics & Roadmap)
- **Stage 1:** Sprint Preparation (Technical Specs & Planning) ← **Architect's Primary Stage**
- **Stage 2:** Sprint Execution (Autonomous Development)
- **Stage 3:** Sprint Validation (QA & Review)
- **Stage 4:** Release & Retrospective

## Current State

The Architect Agent currently has the correct STAD context but needs refinement to:
- Emphasize Stage 1 responsibilities
- Create specs that enable zero-intervention Stage 2 execution
- Include edge case handling and fallback strategies
- Generate proper handoff documents

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Architect Agent understands STAD Stage 1 responsibilities
- [ ] Agent creates comprehensive technical specifications using STAD templates
- [ ] Agent generates dependency DAGs for ticket execution order
- [ ] Agent identifies and documents edge cases with fallback strategies
- [ ] Agent ensures all specs enable autonomous Stage 2 execution
- [ ] Agent creates handoffs at `/Project_Management/Agent_Handoffs/`
- [ ] Agent updates knowledge graph with architectural decisions
- [ ] Agent validates all tickets are ≤5 story points (splits if needed)

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Review Current Agent Configuration
- Verify architect.md has correct STAD context
- Check universal context template references
- Ensure Stage 1 responsibilities are clear

### 2. Enhance Specification Templates
- Update spec template to include edge cases section
- Add fallback strategies section
- Include acceptance criteria checklist

### 3. Improve Handoff Creation
- Standardize handoff format for Stage 1 → Stage 2
- Include all context needed for autonomous execution
- Document design decisions and rationale

### 4. Testing & Validation
- Test agent with sample epic
- Verify spec completeness
- Validate DAG generation
- Ensure handoff quality

## Success Metrics

- Specs enable 90%+ autonomous execution in Stage 2
- Zero missing context issues during Stage 2
- All edge cases have documented fallback strategies
- DAGs correctly identify parallelization opportunities

## Dependencies

- STAD-005: Stage-specific output templates (must be complete)
- STAD-006: Folder organization rules (must be complete)

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:** Agent already has STAD context; this is refinement only

## Notes

This ticket corrects the conceptual misunderstanding from the original spec. We are NOT implementing a 7-stage process. We are migrating FROM the old 7-stage workflow TO the STAD Protocol 5-stage lifecycle.
