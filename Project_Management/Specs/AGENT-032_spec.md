# AGENT-032: Advanced Code Intelligence Agent

## Overview

**Goal:** Create an intelligent code analysis agent that identifies patterns, anti-patterns, refactoring opportunities, and technical debt to provide actionable improvement recommendations.

**Points:** 3  
**Epic:** Agent Intelligence  
**Priority:** High

## Problem Statement

Current development lacks proactive code quality insights:
- Manual identification of refactoring opportunities
- Hidden technical debt accumulation
- Inconsistent pattern usage across codebase
- No automated architecture recommendations
- Reactive rather than proactive quality management

## Solution Design

### Agent Architecture

```yaml
name: code-intelligence
type: analysis
capabilities:
  - pattern_detection
  - anti_pattern_identification
  - refactoring_suggestions
  - technical_debt_quantification
  - architecture_analysis
  - code_smell_detection
```

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Pattern Detection
- Identifies common design patterns in use
- Detects incomplete pattern implementations
- Suggests pattern applications for problem areas
- Maps pattern usage across codebase

#### 2. Anti-Pattern Identification
- Scans for known anti-patterns
- Identifies code smells
- Detects architectural violations
- Finds duplicated logic patterns

#### 3. Refactoring Recommendations
- Suggests method extractions
- Identifies consolidation opportunities
- Recommends abstraction improvements
- Proposes structural refactoring

#### 4. Technical Debt Analysis
- Quantifies debt with metrics
- Prioritizes by impact and effort
- Tracks debt trends over time
- Estimates remediation costs

#### 5. Architecture Insights
- Analyzes module dependencies
- Identifies coupling issues
- Suggests boundary improvements
- Recommends service extractions

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details

**Agent Location:** `/Agents/code-intelligence.md`

**Supporting Tools:** `/tools/code-analysis/`
- `pattern-detector.ts`
- `debt-calculator.ts`
- `refactoring-analyzer.ts`
- `architecture-mapper.ts`

### Analysis Capabilities

```typescript
interface CodeAnalysis {
  patterns: {
    identified: Pattern[];
    incomplete: Pattern[];
    suggested: Pattern[];
  };
  antiPatterns: {
    found: AntiPattern[];
    severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
    location: FileLocation[];
  };
  refactoring: {
    opportunities: Refactoring[];
    priority: number;
    estimatedEffort: number;
    expectedBenefit: number;
  };
  technicalDebt: {
    score: number;
    items: DebtItem[];
    trend: 'increasing' | 'stable' | 'decreasing';
    estimatedHours: number;
  };
  architecture: {
    violations: Violation[];
    suggestions: Suggestion[];
    dependencies: DependencyMap;
  };
}
```

### Integration Points

- **With Coder Agent:** Provides refactoring targets
- **With Architect Agent:** Shares architecture insights
- **With Tester Agent:** Identifies areas needing tests
- **With Security Agent:** Flags security anti-patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Accurately identifies 80%+ of common design patterns
- [ ] Detects critical anti-patterns with 95% accuracy
- [ ] Provides actionable refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Quantifies technical debt with clear metrics
- [ ] Generates architecture dependency graphs
- [ ] Prioritizes improvements by ROI
- [ ] Integrates with existing agent ecosystem
- [ ] Produces markdown reports with findings

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Analyzes 10K lines of code in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage < 100MB during analysis
- [ ] Incremental analysis for large codebases
- [ ] Caches results for unchanged files

### Quality Requirements

- [ ] Zero false positives for critical anti-patterns
- [ ] Clear explanations for all recommendations
- [ ] Actionable suggestions with code examples
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Analysis (Day 1)
- Pattern detection engine
- Anti-pattern identification
- Basic refactoring suggestions

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (Day 2)
- Technical debt calculator
- Architecture analyzer
- Priority scoring system

### Phase 3: Integration (Day 3)
- Agent prompt template
- Report generation
- Integration tests

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases
- Pattern detection accuracy
- Anti-pattern identification
- Refactoring suggestion quality
- Debt calculation correctness
- Architecture analysis validity

### Test Data
- Sample codebases with known patterns
- Intentionally problematic code
- Well-architected reference implementations
- Legacy code samples

## Success Metrics

- **Detection Rate:** 80%+ pattern identification accuracy
- **Quality Impact:** 60%+ reduction in new technical debt
- **Developer Satisfaction:** 4.5+ rating on suggestions
- **Automation:** 70%+ of refactoring opportunities auto-identified

## Agent Prompt Template

```markdown
You are a code intelligence specialist analyzing codebases for quality improvements.

Your capabilities:
1. Pattern Detection - Identify design patterns and their usage
2. Anti-Pattern Identification - Find problematic code patterns
3. Refactoring Suggestions - Recommend code improvements
4. Technical Debt Analysis - Quantify and prioritize debt
5. Architecture Insights - Analyze system structure

Analyze the provided code and return:
- Identified patterns with locations
- Anti-patterns requiring attention
- Top 5 refactoring opportunities
- Technical debt score and items
- Architecture recommendations

Focus on actionable, high-impact improvements.
```

## Dependencies

- Code parsing utilities
- Pattern recognition library
- Metrics calculation tools
- Existing agent framework

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Analysis accuracy | High | Extensive pattern library, continuous tuning |
| Performance on large codebases | Medium | Incremental analysis, caching |
| Suggestion quality | Medium | Human review, feedback loop |
| Integration complexity | Low | Clear API contracts |

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for pattern recognition
- Custom pattern definition support
- IDE plugin for real-time analysis
- Automated refactoring execution
- Cross-language support
