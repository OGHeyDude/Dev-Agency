# AGENT-003: Create Agent Combination Recipes

## Overview
Create a comprehensive set of agent combination recipes that demonstrate powerful multi-agent workflows. These recipes will leverage parallel execution capabilities (up to 5 agents simultaneously) to maximize efficiency while maintaining quality.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Create 5 new agent combination recipes** covering different development scenarios
2. **Demonstrate parallel agent execution** where appropriate
3. **Follow existing recipe template structure** for consistency
4. **Include real-world use cases** for each recipe
5. **Document agent dependencies and sequencing**
6. **Provide clear success criteria** for each recipe

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Quality**: Each recipe must be tested with real scenarios
2. **Efficiency**: Leverage parallel execution to reduce total time
3. **Clarity**: Recipes must be easy to follow and reproduce
4. **Anti-Clutter**: No duplication with existing recipes
5. **Measurability**: Include time estimates and success metrics

## Technical Specification

### Recipe 1: Full Stack Feature Development
**Purpose**: Complete feature development from design to deployment
**Agents Used**: architect, coder, tester, security, documenter, memory-sync
**Parallel Execution**:
- Phase 1: architect (solo)
- Phase 2: coder (solo)
- Phase 3: tester + security + performance (parallel)
- Phase 4: documenter + memory-sync (parallel)

### Recipe 2: Complex Refactoring Workflow
**Purpose**: Large-scale code reorganization with safety
**Agents Used**: memory-sync, clutter-detector, architect, coder, tester
**Parallel Execution**:
- Phase 1: memory-sync (snapshot) + clutter-detector (parallel)
- Phase 2: architect (analysis)
- Phase 3: coder (implementation)
- Phase 4: tester + memory-sync (parallel)

### Recipe 3: Performance Optimization Pipeline
**Purpose**: Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
**Agents Used**: performance, architect, coder, tester, memory-sync
**Parallel Execution**:
- Phase 1: performance + memory-sync (parallel baseline)
- Phase 2: architect (optimization design)
- Phase 3: coder (implementation)
- Phase 4: performance + tester (parallel validation)

### Recipe 4: TDD Development Cycle
**Purpose**: Test-driven development workflow
**Agents Used**: tester, coder, security, documenter, memory-sync
**Parallel Execution**:
- Phase 1: tester (write tests first)
- Phase 2: coder (implement to pass tests)
- Phase 3: security (review)
- Phase 4: documenter + memory-sync (parallel)

### Recipe 5: Database Migration Workflow
**Purpose**: Complex database schema changes with safety
**Agents Used**: architect, integration, coder, tester, documenter
**Parallel Execution**:
- Phase 1: architect + integration (parallel planning)
- Phase 2: coder (migration scripts)
- Phase 3: tester + documenter (parallel)
- Phase 4: integration (validation)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Recipe Development
1. Create base recipe structure for each workflow
2. Define agent invocation sequences
3. Document parallel execution groups
4. Add context templates for each agent

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation
1. Test each recipe with real scenarios
2. Measure execution times
3. Validate parallel execution works correctly
4. Ensure no agent conflicts

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. Update recipes README with new entries
2. Add cross-references between related recipes
3. Document best practices for parallel execution
4. Create troubleshooting guide

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 5 new recipe files created in `/recipes/`
- [ ] Each recipe uses 3-5 agents minimum
- [ ] Parallel execution documented and tested
- [ ] No duplication with existing 7 recipes
- [ ] All recipes follow standard template
- [ ] Time estimates provided and validated
- [ ] Success metrics defined and measurable
- [ ] README.md updated with new recipes
- [ ] Memory graph updated with new patterns

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Each recipe tested independently
2. **Integration Testing**: Recipes tested with real code
3. **Performance Testing**: Measure time savings from parallel execution
4. **Quality Testing**: Verify output quality meets standards

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Token limits with multiple agents
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize context for each agent
- **Risk**: Agent conflicts in parallel execution
  - **Mitigation**: Define clear separation of concerns
- **Risk**: Recipe complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Provide clear examples and templates

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All 5 recipes successfully execute end-to-end
2. Parallel execution reduces total time by >30%
3. Each recipe has been tested 3+ times
4. Documentation is clear and comprehensive
5. No duplication or redundancy detected

## Notes
- Focus on real-world scenarios that developers face daily
- Emphasize the power of parallel agent execution
- Ensure recipes are general enough for multiple projects
- Consider creating a "recipe selector" guide

## Status Updates
- **2025-08-09**: Specification created, implementation started
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS
