# **Spec: Agent Performance Dashboard**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-006`  
**Status:** `BACKLOG`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-10  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Link to Project Plan:** [PROJECT_PLAN.md](../PROJECT_PLAN.md)

## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** Dev-Agency system performance metrics and agent effectiveness data are collected but not easily accessible or visualized. Administrators and users lack real-time visibility into system health, agent performance trends, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities, making it difficult to monitor system effectiveness and make data-driven improvements.

**Goal:** Create an intuitive, real-time performance dashboard that visualizes agent performance metrics, system health indicators, usage patterns, and improvement opportunities, enabling administrators to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the Dev-Agency system effectively.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Real-time dashboard displaying key agent performance metrics (success rates, response times, token usage)
- [ ] System health overview with status indicators and alerts
- [ ] Historical performance trends and analytics visualization
- [ ] Agent-specific performance breakdowns and comparisons
- [ ] Recipe effectiveness tracking and success rate visualization
- [ ] User adoption and feature utilization metrics
- [ ] Performance bottleneck identification and resolution tracking
- [ ] Customizable dashboard layout and metric selection
- [ ] Integration with existing feedback system and metrics collection
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for monitoring on various devices

## **3. Technical Plan**

**Approach:** Build a web-based dashboard using modern visualization libraries that connects to the existing feedback system and metrics infrastructure. Implement real-time data streaming, configurable visualizations, and responsive design for comprehensive system monitoring.

### **Key Metrics and Visualizations**

**Performance Metrics:**
- Agent Success Rate: Real-time gauge with historical trend
- Average Response Time: Time series chart with performance targets
- Token Efficiency: Bar charts comparing agent token usage
- System Uptime: Uptime percentage with downtime incidents

**Usage Analytics:**
- Agent Invocation Frequency: Heatmap by time and agent type

- System Reliability: Error rate trends and recovery times

### **Affected Components**

- Integration with existing feedback system (`/feedback/`)
- Connection to agent CLI metrics collection
- Performance tracking system data sources
- External observability platform APIs (Grafana, DataDog)

### **New Dependencies**

- React + TypeScript for frontend development
- Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
- WebSocket library for real-time updates

## **4. Feature Boundaries & Impact**

### **Owned Resources** (Safe to Modify)
- [ ] `/tools/dashboard/*` (complete dashboard application)
- [ ] `/tools/dashboard/frontend/*` (React application and components)
- [ ] `/tools/dashboard/backend/*` (API server and WebSocket handlers)
- [ ] `/tools/dashboard/docker-compose.yml` (deployment configuration)
- [ ] `/docs/dashboard/*` (dashboard documentation)

### **Shared Dependencies** (Constraints Apply)
