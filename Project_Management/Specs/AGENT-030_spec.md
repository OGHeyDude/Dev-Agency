## **`1. Problem & Goal`**

* **`Problem:`** Sprint planning currently relies on manual estimation and limited historical context. Planning decisions are made without data-driven insights about optimal ticket composition, potential blockers, or velocity trends. This leads to suboptimal sprint planning and unexpected issues that could have been predicted from historical patterns.

* **`Goal:`** Create an intelligent assistant that analyzes historical sprint data to provide actionable insights during sprint planning, including optimal ticket mix suggestions, potential blocker identification, and velocity trend analysis to improve sprint success rates.

## **`2. Acceptance Criteria`**

* `[ ] Assistant analyzes historical sprint completion rates from PROJECT_PLAN.md files`
* `[ ] System identifies patterns in successful sprint compositions (story point distribution, ticket types)`
* `[ ] Tool predicts potential blockers based on similar past tickets and patterns`
* `[ ] Assistant suggests optimal ticket mix for upcoming sprints based on team velocity`
* `[ ] System provides velocity trend analysis showing team performance over time`
* `[ ] Tool integrates with existing sprint planning workflow via slash command (/sprint-predict)`
* `[ ] Assistant outputs actionable recommendations in structured format`
* `[ ] System can be invoked as part of existing /sprint-plan recipe`

## **`3. Technical Plan`**

* **`Approach:`** Create a predictive assistant agent that reads historical PROJECT_PLAN.md files, extracts sprint data, analyzes patterns using basic statistical methods, and provides recommendations via structured prompts. Use existing agent architecture with new specialized prompts for data analysis and prediction.

* **`Affected Components:`** 
  - `/Agents/` - New predictive-planner.md agent definition
  - `/prompts/` - New predictive analysis prompts
  - `/recipes/` - Enhanced sprint_planning_recipe.md integration
  - `/metrics/` - Sprint analysis output files

* **`New Dependencies:`** None - uses existing agent framework and file analysis capabilities

* **`Database Changes:`** None - reads existing PROJECT_PLAN.md files and sprint data from filesystem
