# **Spec: Security Audit Workflow Recipe**

**Ticket ID:** `AGENT-008`  
**Status:** `TODO`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-09  
**Story Points:** 2  

---

## **1. Problem & Goal**

**Problem:** Security audits are often incomplete or inconsistent, missing critical vulnerabilities. Teams lack systematic approaches for OWASP compliance and comprehensive security validation.

**Goal:** Create a security audit recipe that leverages the security agent with supporting agents to perform thorough, OWASP-compliant security assessments with clear remediation priorities.

## **2. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Complete OWASP Top 10 coverage
- [ ] Security agent leads with support from other agents
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning patterns
- [ ] Risk prioritization framework included
- [ ] Remediation guidance provided
- [ ] Compliance reporting templates
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Post-fix validation procedures

## **3. Technical Plan**

### **Recipe Phases**

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance**
- Code inventory and attack surface mapping
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Configuration review

**Phase 2: Security Analysis (Parallel)**
- `/agent:security` - Primary vulnerability assessment
- `/agent:architect` - Architecture security review
- `/agent:tester` - Security test creation

**Phase 3: Remediation**
- Priority-based fix implementation
- `/agent:coder` - Security patches
- `/agent:security` - Fix validation

**Phase 4: Documentation**
- Security report generation
- Compliance certification
- Remediation tracking

### **OWASP Coverage**

1. Injection vulnerabilities
2. Authentication weaknesses
3. Sensitive data exposure
4. XML external entities
5. Access control issues
6. Security misconfiguration
7. Cross-site scripting
8. Insecure deserialization
9. Component vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient logging
