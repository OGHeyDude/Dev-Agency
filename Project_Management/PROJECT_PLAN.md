# **Dev-Agency - Project Plan**

**Last Updated:** 08-09-2025

This document is the central source of truth for the Dev-Agency project. It contains the high-level roadmap, a detailed backlog of work, and the plan for the current sprint.

## **1. Project Vision & Goals**

* **Vision:** Build an enterprise-grade agentic development system that leverages Claude Code's architecture to create a powerful, scalable development workflow with specialized AI agents.

* **High-Level Goals (Q1 2025):**
  * Launch functional agent system with core agents operational
  * Establish performance tracking and continuous improvement processes
  * Create comprehensive documentation and prompt libraries
  * Validate system with real development tasks
  * Build a library of proven agent combination recipes

* **Link to Project Changelog:** `/Project_Management/Releases/CHANGELOG.md`

## **2. Current Sprint**

* **Sprint Dates:** 08-24-2025 – 09-07-2025  
* **Sprint Goal:** Complete Sprint 2 remaining work and resolve critical security/build issues

## **6. Notes**

### Sprint Planning Guidelines
- Focus on validating the system with real tasks first
- Prioritize recipes that demonstrate agent capabilities
- ~~Build metrics to guide continuous improvement~~ Use external Observability Tool

### Cancelled Items
- **AGENT-002**: Performance tracking system cancelled (08-09-2025)
  - Reason: Will use external Observability Tool instead
  - Archived: /metrics/ directory moved to /Archive/

### Success Metrics
- Agent invocation success rate > 90% ✅ (Achieved in Sprint 2)
- Average context size optimization of 30% ✅ (44-75% achieved)
- Time savings of 40% on complex tasks ✅ (65-76% achieved)
- Zero agent-to-agent communication violations ✅ (Hub-and-Spoke maintained)

### Sprint 3 Success Metrics
- All security vulnerabilities resolved (CRITICAL)
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Memory usage bounded <200MB for any execution count
- Context cache hit rate >70%
- AGENT-010 100% functional with all modules

### Risk Management  
- **Risk**: Token limits on complex contexts
  - **Mitigation**: ✅ Context optimizer tool (AGENT-010) 60% complete, Sprint 3 completion
- **Risk**: Agent selection confusion  
  - **Mitigation**: ✅ Selection assistant (AGENT-011) specification complete
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in production (NEW)
  - **Mitigation**: SECURITY-001 Sprint 3 priority (code injection, path traversal)
- **Risk**: Memory leaks in long-running operations (NEW)
  - **Mitigation**: LRU cache implementation and memory management (PERF-001)
- **Risk**: Build system instability (NEW)
  - **Mitigation**: TypeScript compilation fixes and automated validation (BUILD-001)
