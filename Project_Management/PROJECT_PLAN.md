## **6. Notes**

### Sprint Planning Guidelines
- Focus on validating the system with real tasks first
- Prioritize recipes that demonstrate agent capabilities
- ~~Build metrics to guide continuous improvement~~ Use external Observability Tool

### Cancelled Items
- **AGENT-002**: Performance tracking system cancelled (08-09-2025)
  - Reason: Will use external Observability Tool instead
  - Archived: /metrics/ directory moved to /Archive/

### Success Metrics
- Agent invocation success rate > 90% ✅ (Achieved in Sprint 2)
- Average context size optimization of 30% ✅ (44-75% achieved)
- Time savings of 40% on complex tasks ✅ (65-76% achieved)
- Zero agent-to-agent communication violations ✅ (Hub-and-Spoke maintained)

### Sprint 5 Success Metrics
- [ ] Real-time monitoring operational with <100ms latency
- [ ] VS Code extension installed and functional
- [ ] VCS integration working with GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] Production health checks passing at 99.9% uptime
- [ ] All specs written before implementation (100%)
- [ ] Documentation coverage maintained at 100%

### Risk Management  
- **Risk**: Token limits on complex contexts
  - **Mitigation**: ✅ Context optimizer tool (AGENT-010) 60% complete, Sprint 3 completion
- **Risk**: Agent selection confusion  
  - **Mitigation**: ✅ Selection assistant (AGENT-011) specification complete
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in production (NEW)
  - **Mitigation**: SECURITY-001 Sprint 3 priority (code injection, path traversal)
- **Risk**: Memory leaks in long-running operations (NEW)
  - **Mitigation**: LRU cache implementation and memory management (PERF-001)
- **Risk**: Build system instability (NEW)
  - **Mitigation**: TypeScript compilation fixes and automated validation (BUILD-001)
