# **Dev-Agency - Project Plan**

**Last Updated:** 08-09-2025

This document is the central source of truth for the Dev-Agency project. It contains the high-level roadmap, a detailed backlog of work, and the plan for the current sprint.

## **1. Project Vision & Goals**

* **Vision:** Build an enterprise-grade agentic development system that leverages Claude Code's architecture to create a powerful, scalable development workflow with specialized AI agents.

* **High-Level Goals (Q1 2025):**
  * Launch functional agent system with core agents operational
  * Establish performance tracking and continuous improvement processes
  * Create comprehensive documentation and prompt libraries
  * Validate system with real development tasks
  * Build a library of proven agent combination recipes

* **Link to Project Changelog:** `/Project_Management/Releases/CHANGELOG.md`

## **2. Current Sprint**

* **Sprint Dates:** 08-24-2025 – 09-07-2025  
* **Sprint Goal:** Complete Sprint 2 remaining work and resolve critical security/build issues

## **3. Roadmap (Epics)**

Epics are large bodies of work or features. They are broken down into smaller, actionable tickets in the backlog below.

| Epic | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System Foundation | Core agent definitions and architecture | `Done` |
| Integration Framework | CLAUDE.md integration and workflow enhancement | `In Progress` |
| Performance Tracking | Metrics, logging, and improvement systems | `In Progress` |
| Recipe Library | Documented agent combinations for common tasks | `Planned` |
| Prompt Engineering | Domain-specific prompt libraries and versioning | `Planned` |
| Continuous Improvement | Feedback loops and system evolution | `Planned` |

## **4. Backlog (All Tickets)**

This is the master list of all work to be done. Tickets are pulled from here into a sprint when they are in the `TODO` state.

* **Ticket Statuses:** `BACKLOG` → `TODO` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `CODE_REVIEW` → `QA_TESTING` → `DOCUMENTATION` → `READY_FOR_RELEASE` → `DONE`

## **6. Notes**

### Sprint Planning Guidelines
- Focus on validating the system with real tasks first
- Prioritize recipes that demonstrate agent capabilities
- ~~Build metrics to guide continuous improvement~~ Use external Observability Tool

### Cancelled Items
- **AGENT-002**: Performance tracking system cancelled (08-09-2025)
  - Reason: Will use external Observability Tool instead
  - Archived: /metrics/ directory moved to /Archive/

### Success Metrics
- Agent invocation success rate > 90%
- Average context size optimization of 30%
- Time savings of 40% on complex tasks
- Zero agent-to-agent communication violations

### Risk Management
- **Risk**: Token limits on complex contexts
  - **Mitigation**: Build context optimizer tool (AGENT-010)
- **Risk**: Agent selection confusion
  - **Mitigation**: Create selection assistant (AGENT-011)
