## 📋 Key Information Now in Memory

1. **Integration Method:** GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the sole GitHub integration
2. **Agent Support:** New GitHub CLI Agent available
3. **Documentation:** Complete guide at `/docs/integrations/github-cli-guide.md`
4. **Configuration:** MCP server removed, CLI configured
5. **Token Requirements:** repo, project, workflow scopes needed

---

## 🎯 Impact on System

### What Changed
- GitHub operations now faster (direct CLI vs MCP server)
- Simpler architecture (one less server component)
- Better reliability (official GitHub tool)
- Clearer documentation (explicit CLI usage)

### What Remains
- Full GitHub functionality maintained
- All operations still available
- Token-based authentication unchanged
- Project board access confirmed

---

## 📝 Next Steps

The Memory Graph now accurately reflects:
1. Current GitHub integration method (CLI)
2. Available agents for GitHub operations
3. Configuration requirements
4. System architecture changes

No further Memory Graph updates needed for this change.
