Stage: Stage 2 (Sprint Execution)
Ticket: STAD-009

## Work Completed
- Reviewed existing sprint planning templates
- Verified execution_plan_template.md in templates folder
- Reviewed actual sprint plans (Sprint_8_Plan_Enhanced.md)
- Confirmed STAD 5-stage alignment in existing templates

## Files Reviewed
- `/docs/reference/templates/execution_plan_template.md` - DAG-based execution planning
- `/Project_Management/Sprint_Plans/Sprint_8_Plan_Enhanced.md` - Real example with STAD alignment
- `/recipes/sprint_preparation_recipe.md` - Contains sprint planning process

## Key Findings
1. **Sprint Planning Already Exists**
   - Comprehensive execution plan template with DAG structure
   - Real sprint plans demonstrate STAD alignment
   - Agent Execution Matrix included
   - Parallel execution rules defined

2. **STAD 5-Stage Coverage**
   - Stage 1: Sprint preparation covered in recipe
   - Stage 2: Execution planning in templates
   - Stage 3: Validation checkpoints included
   - Stage 4: Retrospective inputs defined

3. **Template Features**
   - Task breakdown with story points
   - Dependency graphs (mermaid)
   - Critical path identification
   - Parallel execution opportunities
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Progress tracking metrics

## Recommendation
The existing sprint planning templates and processes are comprehensive and STAD-aligned. No new template creation needed. The Sprint_8_Plan_Enhanced.md serves as an excellent example of the template in action.
