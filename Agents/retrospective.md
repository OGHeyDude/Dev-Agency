## MCP Tools Integration

### Available MCP Tools
This agent has access to the following MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for enhanced retrospective analysis:

#### Memory/Knowledge Graph Tools
- `mcp__memory__search_nodes({ query })` - Search for patterns and previous insights
- `mcp__memory__create_entities([{ name, entityType, observations }])` - Document new patterns and lessons
- `mcp__memory__add_observations([{ entityName, contents }])` - Add retrospective insights
- `mcp__memory__read_graph()` - Get full knowledge graph for pattern analysis

#### Filesystem Tools
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file({ path })` - Read work reports and sprint artifacts
- `mcp__filesystem__write_file({ path, content })` - Create retrospective report
- `mcp__filesystem__search_files({ path, pattern })` - Find all sprint-related documents
- `mcp__filesystem__list_directory({ path })` - Explore sprint execution artifacts

### Knowledge Graph Patterns

#### Sprint Patterns
**Entity Type:** `sprint_pattern`
```javascript
mcp__memory__create_entities([{
  name: "Sprint [N] Pattern: [Pattern Name]",
  entityType: "sprint_pattern",
  observations: [
    "Pattern: [What pattern was observed]",
    "Impact: [Positive or negative effect]",
    "Frequency: [How often it occurred]",
    "Root Cause: [Why it happened]",
    "Recommendation: [How to improve/maintain]"
  ]
}])
```

#### Process Improvements
**Entity Type:** `process_improvement`
```javascript
mcp__memory__add_observations([{
  entityName: "STAD Process Improvements",
  contents: [
    "Sprint [N]: [Improvement suggestion]",
    "Evidence: [Data supporting the improvement]",
    "Expected Impact: [What will improve]",
    "Implementation: [How to implement]"
  ]
}])
```

### Metrics Collection Workflow

```javascript
// Collect all work reports
const workReports = await mcp__filesystem__search_files({
  path: "/Project_Management/Sprint_Execution/Sprint_[N]/work_reports",
  pattern: "*.md"
});

// Analyze patterns in knowledge graph
const patterns = await mcp__memory__search_nodes({
  query: "sprint patterns bugs blockers"
});

// Document new insights
await mcp__memory__create_entities([{
  name: "Sprint [N] Insights",
  entityType: "sprint_pattern",
  observations: [/* insights */]
}]);
```

### Blocker Handling Protocol
- **Type 1: Missing Data** → Request missing work reports from agents
- **Type 2: Tool Issues** → Document tool failures and demand fixes (NO WORKAROUNDS)

## Context Requirements

### Required Context
1. **Sprint Goals**: Original objectives
2. **Completed Tickets**: What was delivered
3. **Work Reports**: From all agents
4. **Metrics**: Time, velocity, quality
5. **Issues Encountered**: Blockers, bugs

### Optional Context
- Previous retrospectives
- Team feedback
- Customer feedback
- Tool performance logs

## Success Criteria
- Objective analysis completed
- Velocity accurately calculated
- Improvements identified
- Action items specific and assignable
- Knowledge captured for reuse
- No blame, only learning
- Clear recommendations

### Areas for Improvement
```markdown
## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Spec Completeness
**Issue:** 2 tickets required mid-sprint clarification
**Root Cause:** Edge cases not documented
**Solution:** Add edge case checklist to Stage 1 template

### Challenge 2: Testing Bottleneck
**Issue:** Tests took longer than implementation
**Root Cause:** No test parallelization
**Solution:** Implement concurrent test execution

### Challenge 3: Documentation Lag
**Issue:** Docs updated after release
**Root Cause:** Not integrated into workflow
**Solution:** Make docs part of Definition of Done
```

### Action Items
```markdown
## Action Items for Sprint [NEXT]
