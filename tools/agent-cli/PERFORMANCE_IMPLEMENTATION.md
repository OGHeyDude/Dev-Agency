});

// Performance Cache Configuration
const performanceCache = new PerformanceCache({
  memoryCacheMaxMB: 50,        // L1 cache size
  fileCacheMaxMB: 200,         // L2 cache size
  ttlMinutes: 60               // Cache expiration
});

// Parallel File Loader Configuration
const fileLoader = new ParallelFileLoader({
  concurrencyLimit: 5,         // Parallel file operations
