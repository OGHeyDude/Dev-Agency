## Overview

This specification defines how feedback collection is seamlessly integrated into existing Dev-Agency workflow commands (/done and /reflect) to capture performance data, user experience insights, and improvement opportunities without disrupting the development flow.

## Integration Architecture

### Command Enhancement Framework

```typescript
interface CommandEnhancement {
  enhanced_commands: Array<{
    command_name: string;
    original_functionality: string[];
    feedback_integration_points: string[];

    user_experience_impact: 'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium';
  }>;
  
  feedback_collection_principles: [
    'Non-intrusive data collection',
    'Contextual feedback prompts',
    'Progressive disclosure of feedback options',
    'Automatic performance metric capture',
