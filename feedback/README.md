## Best Practices

### For Providing Quality Feedback

#### 1. Be Specific and Actionable
```markdown
❌ "The agent was slow"
✅ "The coder agent took 45 seconds to generate a simple function, expected ~10 seconds"

❌ "Recipe didn't work"  
✅ "Step 3 of API recipe failed because it couldn't find the database config file"
```

#### 2. Include Context
```markdown
✅ "Working on React component with TypeScript, medium complexity task"
✅ "First time using this agent, junior developer experience level"
✅ "Time-sensitive bug fix, needed quick solution"
```

#### 3. Suggest Improvements
```markdown
✅ "Could the agent prompt include an example of the expected output format?"
✅ "Would be helpful if the recipe checked for prerequisites before starting"
✅ "Error message could be more specific about what went wrong"
```
